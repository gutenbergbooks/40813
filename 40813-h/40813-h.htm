<h2 class="top6"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>‘Smoke’ was first published in 1867, several
years after Turgenev had fixed his home in
Baden, with his friends the Viardots. Baden
at this date was a favourite resort for all circles
of Russian society, and Turgenev was able to
study at his leisure his countrymen as they
appeared to foreign critical eyes. The novel is
therefore the most cosmopolitan of all Turgenev’s
works. On a veiled background of the
great world of European society, little groups
of representative Russians, members of the
aristocratic and the Young Russia parties, are
etched with an incisive, unfaltering hand.
<i>Smoke</i>, as an historical study, though it yields
in importance to <i>Fathers and Children</i> and
<i>Virgin Soil</i>, is of great significance to Russians.
It might with truth have been named <i>Transition</i>,
for the generation it paints was then midway
between the early philosophical Nihilism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">-vi-</a></span>
of the sixties and the active political Nihilism
of the seventies.</p>

<p>Markedly transitional, however, as was the
Russian mind of the days of <i>Smoke</i>, Turgenev,
with the faculty that distinguishes the great
artist from the artist of second rank, the faculty
of seeking out and stamping the essential under
confused and fleeting forms, has once and for
ever laid bare the fundamental weakness of the
Slav nature, its weakness of will. <i>Smoke</i> is an
attack, a deserved attack, not merely on the
Young Russia Party, but on all the Parties; not
on the old ideas or the new ideas, but on the
proneness of the Slav nature to fall a prey to
a consuming weakness, a moral stagnation, a
feverish <i>ennui</i>, the Slav nature that analyses
everything with force and brilliancy, and ends,
so often, by doing nothing. <i>Smoke</i> is the attack,
bitter yet sympathetic, of a man who, with growing
despair, has watched the weakness of his
countrymen, while he loves his country all the
more for the bitterness their sins have brought
upon it. <i>Smoke</i> is the scourging of a babbling
generation, by a man who, grown sick to death
of the chatter of reformers and reactionists, is
visiting the sins of the fathers on the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">-vii-</a></span>
with a contempt out of patience for the hereditary
vice in the Slav blood. And this time the
author cannot be accused of partisanship by any
blunderer. ‘A plague o’ both your houses,’ is
his message equally to the Bureaucrats and the
Revolutionists. And so skilfully does he wield
the thong, that every lash falls on the back of
both parties. An exquisite piece of political
satire is <i>Smoke;</i> for this reason alone it would
stand unique among novels.</p>

<p>The success of <i>Smoke</i> was immediate and
great; but the hue-and-cry that assailed it was
even greater. The publication of the book
marks the final rupture between Turgenev
and the party of Young Russia. The younger
generation never forgave him for drawing Gubaryov
and Bambaev, Voroshilov and Madame
Suhantchikov&mdash;types, indeed, in which all
revolutionary or unorthodox parties are painfully
rich. Or, perhaps, Turgenev was forgiven
for it when he was in his grave, a spot where
forgiveness flowers to a late perfection. And
yet the fault was not Turgenev’s. No, his last
novel, <i>Virgin Soil</i>, bears splendid witness that it
was Young Russia that was one-eyed.</p>

<p>Let the plain truth here be set down. <i>Smoke</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>
is not a complete picture of the Young Russia
of the day; it was not yet time for that picture;
and that being so, Turgenev did the next best
thing in attacking the windbags, the charlatans
and their crowd of shallow, chattering followers,
as well as the empty formulas of the <i>laissez-faire</i>
party. It was inevitable that the attack
should bring on him the anger of all young
enthusiasts working for ‘the Cause’; it was inevitable
that ‘the Cause’ of reform in Russia
should be mixed up with the Gubaryovs, just as
reforms in France a few years ago were mixed up
with Boulanger; and that Turgenev’s waning
popularity for the last twenty years of his life
should be directly caused by his honesty and
clear-sightedness in regard to Russian Liberalism,
was inevitable also. To be crucified by
those you have benefited is the cross of honour
of all great, single-hearted men.</p>

<p>But though the bitterness of political life
flavours <i>Smoke</i>, although its points of departure
and arrival are wrapped in the atmosphere of
Russia’s dark and insoluble problems, nevertheless
the two central figures of the book,
Litvinov and Irina, are not political figures.
Luckily for them, in Gubaryov’s words, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">-ix-</a></span>
belong ‘to the undeveloped.’ Litvinov himself
may be dismissed in a sentence. He is Turgenev’s
favourite type of man, a character much
akin to his own nature, gentle, deep, and sympathetic.
Turgenev often drew such a character;
Lavretsky, for example, in <i>A House of
Gentlefolk</i>, is a first cousin to Litvinov, an older
and a sadder man.</p>

<p>But Irina&mdash;Irina is unique; for Turgenev has
in her perfected her type till she reaches a
destroying witchery of fascination and subtlety.
Irina will stand for ever in the long gallery of
great creations, smiling with that enigmatical
smile which took from Litvinov in a glance
half his life, and his love for Tatyana. The
special triumph of her creation is that she combines
that exact balance between good and
evil which makes good women seem insipid
beside her and bad women unnatural. And,
by nature irresistible, she is made doubly so to
the imagination by the situation which she
recreates between Litvinov and herself. She
ardently desires to become nobler, to possess
all that the ideal of love means for the heart of
woman; but she has only the power given to
her of enervating the man she loves. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">-x-</a></span>
she become a Tatyana to him? No, to no
man. She is born to corrupt, yet never to be
corrupted. She rises mistress of herself after
the first measure of fatal delight. And, never
giving her whole heart absolutely to her lover,
she, nevertheless, remains ever to be desired.</p>

<p>Further, her wit, her scorn, her beauty preserve
her from all the influences of evil she does
not deliberately employ. Such a woman is as
old and as rare a type as Helen of Troy. It is
most often found among the great mistresses
of princes, and it was from a mistress of
Alexander <span class="smaller">II.</span> that Turgenev modelled Irina.</p>

<p>Of the minor characters, Tatyana is an
astonishing instance of Turgenev’s skill in
drawing a complete character with half-a-dozen
strokes of the pen. The reader seems to have
known her intimately all his life: her family life,
her girlhood, her goodness and individual ways
to the smallest detail; yet she only speaks on
two or three occasions. Potugin is but a weary
shadow of Litvinov, but it is difficult to say
how much this is a telling refinement of art.
The shadow of this prematurely exhausted
man is cast beforehand by Irina across Litvinov’s
future. For Turgenev to have drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">-xi-</a></span>
Potugin as an ordinary individual would have
vulgarised the novel and robbed it of its skilful
proportions, for Potugin is one of those
shadowy figures which supply the chiaroscuro
to a brilliant etching.</p>

<p>As a triumphant example of consummate
technical skill, <i>Smoke</i> will repay the most exact
scrutiny. There are a lightness and a grace
about the novel that conceal its actual strength.
The political argument glides with such ease in
and out of the love story, that the hostile critic
is absolutely baffled; and while the most intricate
steps are executed in the face of a crowd
of angry enemies, the performer lands smiling
and in safety. The art by which Irina’s disastrous
fascination results in falsity, and Litvinov’s
desperate striving after sincerity ends
in rehabilitation,&mdash;the art by which these two
threads are spun, till their meaning colours the
faint political message of the book, is so delicate
that, like the silken webs which gleam only for
the first fresh hours in the forest, it leaves no
trace, but becomes a dream in the memory.
And yet this book, which has the freshness of
windy rain and the whirling of autumn leaves,
is a story of ignominious weakness, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">-xii-</a></span>
passion that kills, that degrades, that renders
life despicable, as Turgenev himself says.
<i>Smoke</i> is the finest example in literature of
a subjective psychological study of passion
rendered clearly and objectively in terms of
French art. Its character, we will not say
its superiority, lies in the extraordinary clearness
with which the most obscure mental
phenomena are analysed in relation to the
ordinary values of daily life. At the precise
point of psychological analysis where Tolstoi
wanders and does not convince the reader, and
at the precise point where Dostoievsky’s analysis
seems exaggerated and obscure, like a figure
looming through the mist, Turgenev throws a
ray of light from the outer to the inner world
of man, and the two worlds are revealed in the
natural depths of their connection. It is in fact
difficult to find among the great modern artists
men whose natural balance of intellect can
be said to equalise their special genius. The
Greeks alone present to the world a spectacle
of a triumphant harmony in the critical and
creative mind of man, and this is their great
pre-eminence. But <i>Smoke</i> presents the curious
feature of a novel (Slav in virtue of its modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">-xiii-</a></span>
psychological genius) which is classical in its
treatment and expression throughout: the balance
of Turgenev’s intellect reigns ever supreme
over the natural morbidity of his subject.</p>

<p>And thus <i>Smoke</i> in every sense of the word
is a classic for all time.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a></h2>


<p>On the 10th of August 1862, at four o’clock in
the afternoon, a great number of people were
thronging before the well-known <i>Konversation</i>
in Baden-Baden. The weather was lovely;
everything around&mdash;the green trees, the bright
houses of the gay city, and the undulating
outline of the mountains&mdash;everything was in
holiday mood, basking in the rays of the
kindly sunshine; everything seemed smiling
with a sort of blind, confiding delight; and the
same glad, vague smile strayed over the human
faces too, old and young, ugly and beautiful
alike. Even the blackened and whitened
visages of the Parisian demi-monde could not
destroy the general impression of bright content
and elation, while their many-coloured
ribbons and feathers and the sparks of gold
and steel on their hats and veils involuntarily
recalled the intensified brilliance and light
fluttering of birds in spring, with their rainbow-tinted
wings. But the dry, guttural snapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-2-</a></span>
of the French jargon, heard on all sides
could not equal the song of birds, nor be compared
with it.</p>

<p>Everything, however, was going on in its accustomed
way. The orchestra in the Pavilion
played first a medley from the Traviata, then
one of Strauss’s waltzes, then ‘Tell her,’ a
Russian song, adapted for instruments by an
obliging conductor. In the gambling saloons,
round the green tables, crowded the same
familiar figures, with the same dull, greedy,
half-stupefied, half-exasperated, wholly rapacious
expression, which the gambling fever
lends to all, even the most aristocratic, features.
The same well-fed and ultra-fashionably dressed
Russian landowner from Tambov with wide
staring eyes leaned over the table, and with
uncomprehending haste, heedless of the cold
smiles of the croupiers themselves, at the very
instant of the cry ‘<i>rien ne va plus</i>,’ laid with
perspiring hand golden rings of <i>louis d’or</i> on all
the four corners of the roulette, depriving himself
by so doing of every possibility of gaining
anything, even in case of success. This did
not in the least prevent him the same evening
from affirming the contrary with disinterested
indignation to Prince Kokó, one of the well-known
leaders of the aristocratic opposition,
the Prince Kokó, who in Paris at the salon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-3-</a></span>
of the Princess Mathilde, so happily remarked
in the presence of the Emperor: ‘<i>Madame,
le principe de la propriété est profondément
ébranlé en Russie</i>.’ At the Russian tree, <i>à
l’arbre Russe</i>, our dear fellow-countrymen and
countrywomen were assembled after their wont.
They approached haughtily and carelessly in
fashionable style, greeted each other with
dignity and elegant ease, as befits beings who
find themselves at the topmost pinnacle of
contemporary culture. But when they had
met and sat down together, they were absolutely
at a loss for anything to say to one
another, and had to be content with a pitiful
interchange of inanities, or with the exceedingly
indecent and exceedingly insipid old jokes of
a hopelessly stale French wit, once a journalist,
a chattering buffoon with Jewish shoes on his
paltry little legs, and a contemptible little
beard on his mean little visage. He retailed
to them, <i>à ces princes russes</i>, all the sweet absurdities
from the old comic almanacs <i>Charivari</i>
and <i>Tintamarre</i>, and they, <i>ces princes russes</i>,
burst into grateful laughter, as though forced
in spite of themselves to recognise the crushing
superiority of foreign wit, and their own
hopeless incapacity to invent anything amusing.
Yet here were almost all the ‘<i>fine fleur</i>’ of
our society, ‘all the high-life and mirrors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-4-</a></span>
fashion.’ Here was Count X., our incomparable
dilettante, a profoundly musical nature, who so
divinely recites songs on the piano, but cannot
in fact take two notes correctly without fumbling
at random on the keys, and sings in a
style something between that of a poor gypsy
singer and a Parisian hairdresser. Here was
our enchanting Baron Q., a master in every
line: literature, administration, oratory, and
card-sharping. Here, too, was Prince Y., the
friend of religion and the people, who in the
blissful epoch when the spirit-trade was a
monopoly, had made himself betimes a huge
fortune by the sale of vodka adulterated with
belladonna; and the brilliant General O. O., who
had achieved the subjugation of something, and
the pacification of something else, and who
is nevertheless still a nonentity, and does not
know what to do with himself. And R. R. the
amusing fat man, who regards himself as a great
invalid and a great wit, though he is, in fact, as
strong as a bull, and as dull as a post.... This
R. R. is almost the only man in our day who
has preserved the traditions of the dandies of
the forties, of the epoch of the ‘Hero of our
Times,’ and the Countess Vorotinsky. He has
preserved, too, the special gait with the swing
on the heels, and <i>le culte de la pose</i> (it cannot
even be put into words in Russian), the unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-5-</a></span>
deliberation of movement, the sleepy
dignity of expression, the immovable, offended-looking
countenance, and the habit of interrupting
other people’s remarks with a yawn,
gazing at his own finger-nails, laughing through
his nose, suddenly shifting his hat from the
back of his head on to his eyebrows, etc.
Here, too, were people in government circles,
diplomats, big-wigs with European names,
men of wisdom and intellect, who imagine
that the Golden Bull was an edict of the
Pope, and that the English poor-tax is a
tax levied on the poor. And here, too, were
the hot-blooded, though tongue-tied, devotees
of the <i>dames aux camellias</i>, young society
dandies, with superb partings down the back of
their heads, and splendid drooping whiskers,
dressed in real London costumes, young bucks
whom one would fancy there was nothing to
hinder from becoming as vulgar as the illustrious
French wit above mentioned. But no!
our home products are not in fashion it seems;
and Countess S., the celebrated arbitress of
fashion and <i>grand genre</i>, by spiteful tongues
nicknamed ‘Queen of the Wasps,’ and ‘Medusa
in a mob-cap,’ prefers, in the absence of the
French wit, to consort with the Italians, Moldavians,
American spiritualists, smart secretaries
of foreign embassies, and Germans of effeminate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span>
but prematurely circumspect, physiognomy, of
whom the place is full. The example of the
Countess is followed by the Princess Babette,
she in whose arms Chopin died (the ladies in
Europe in whose arms he expired are to be
reckoned by thousands); and the Princess
Annette, who would have been perfectly captivating,
if the simple village washerwoman had
not suddenly peeped out in her at times, like a
smell of cabbage wafted across the most delicate
perfume; and Princess Pachette, to whom the
following mischance had occurred: her husband
had fallen into a good berth, and all at
once, <i>Dieu sait pourquoi</i>, he had thrashed the
provost and stolen 20,000 roubles of public
money; and the laughing Princess Zizi; and the
tearful Princess Zozo. They all left their compatriots
on one side, and were merciless in their
treatment of them. Let us too leave them on
one side, these charming ladies, and walk away
from the renowned tree near which they sit in
such costly but somewhat tasteless costumes,
and God grant them relief from the boredom
consuming them!</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h2>


<p>A few paces from the ‘Russian tree,’ at a
little table in front of Weber’s coffee-house,
there was sitting a good-looking man, about
thirty, of medium height, thin and dark, with a
manly and pleasant face. He sat bending
forward with both arms leaning on his stick,
with the calm and simple air of a man to whom
the idea had not occurred that any one would
notice him or pay any attention to him. His
large expressive golden-brown eyes were gazing
deliberately about him, sometimes screwed up to
keep the sunshine out of them, and then watching
fixedly some eccentric figure that passed by him
while a childlike smile faintly stirred his fine
moustache and lips, and his prominent short chin.
He wore a roomy coat of German cut, and a soft
grey hat hid half of his high forehead. At the
first glance he made the impression of an honest,
sensible, rather self-confident young man such as
there are many in the world. He seemed to
be resting from prolonged labours and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-8-</a></span>
deriving all the more simple-minded amusement
from the scene spread out before him
because his thoughts were far away, and because
they moved too, those thoughts, in a world
utterly unlike that which surrounded him at
the moment. He was a Russian; his name
was Grigory Mihalovitch Litvinov.</p>

<p>We have to make his acquaintance, and so
it will be well to relate in a few words his past,
which presents little of much interest or complexity.</p>

<p>He was the son of an honest retired official
of plebeian extraction, but he was educated,
not as one would naturally expect, in the town,
but in the country. His mother was of noble
family, and had been educated in a government
school. She was a good-natured and very
enthusiastic creature, not devoid of character,
however. Though she was twenty years younger
than her husband, she remodelled him, as far as
she could, drew him out of the petty official
groove into the landowner’s way of life, and
softened and refined his harsh and stubborn
character. Thanks to her, he began to dress
with neatness, and to behave with decorum;
he came to respect learned men and learning,
though, of course, he never took a single book
in his hand; he gave up swearing, and tried
in every way not to demean himself. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-9-</a></span>
even arrived at walking more quietly and speaking
in a subdued voice, mostly of elevated
subjects, which cost him no small effort. ‘Ah!
they ought to be flogged, and that’s all about
it!’ he sometimes thought to himself, but aloud
he pronounced: ‘Yes, yes, that’s so ... of
course; it is a great question.’ Litvinov’s mother
set her household too upon a European footing;
she addressed the servants by the plural ‘you’
instead of the familiar ‘thou,’ and never allowed
any one to gorge himself into a state of lethargy
at her table. As regards the property belonging
to her, neither she nor her husband was capable
of looking after it at all. It had been long
allowed to run to waste, but there was plenty of
land, with all sorts of useful appurtenances, forest-lands
and a lake, on which there had once stood
a factory, which had been founded by a zealous
but unsystematic owner, and had flourished in
the hands of a scoundrelly merchant, and gone
utterly to ruin under the superintendence of
a conscientious German manager. Madame
Litvinov was contented so long as she did not
dissipate her fortune or contract debts. Unluckily
she could not boast of good health, and
she died of consumption in the very year that
her son entered the Moscow university. He did
not complete his course there owing to circumstances
of which the reader will hear more later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-10-</a></span>
on, and went back to his provincial home, where
he idled away some time without work and without
ties, almost without acquaintances. Thanks
to the disinclination for active service of the local
gentry, who were, however, not so much penetrated
by the Western theory of the evils of
‘absenteeism,’ as by the home-grown conviction
that ‘one’s own shirt is the nearest to one’s
skin,’ he was drawn for military service in 1855,
and almost died of typhus in the Crimea, where
he spent six months in a mud-hut on the shore
of the Putrid Sea, without ever seeing a single
ally. After that, he served, not of course
without unpleasant experiences, on the councils
of the nobility, and after being a little time in
the country, acquired a passion for farming. He
realised that his mother’s property, under the
indolent and feeble management of his infirm
old father, did not yield a tenth of the revenue
it might yield, and that in experienced and
skilful hands it might be converted into a perfect
gold mine. But he realised, too, that experience
and skill were just what he lacked&mdash;and he
went abroad to study agriculture and technology&mdash;to
learn them from the first rudiments. More
than four years he had spent in Mecklenburg,
in Silesia, and in Carlsruhe, and he had travelled
in Belgium and in England. He had worked
conscientiously and accumulated information;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-11-</a></span>
he had not acquired it easily; but he had persevered
through his difficulties to the end, and
now with confidence in himself, in his future,
and in his usefulness to his neighbours, perhaps
even to the whole countryside, he was preparing
to return home, where he was summoned
with despairing prayers and entreaties in every
letter from his father, now completely bewildered
by the emancipation, the re-division of lands,
and the terms of redemption&mdash;by the new
régime in short. But why was he in Baden?</p>

<p>Well, he was in Baden because he was from
day to day expecting the arrival there of his
cousin and betrothed, Tatyana Petrovna Shestov.
He had known her almost from childhood, and
had spent the spring and summer with her at
Dresden, where she was living with her aunt.
He felt sincere love and profound respect for
his young kinswoman, and on the conclusion of
his dull preparatory labours, when he was preparing
to enter on a new field, to begin real,
unofficial duties, he proposed to her as a woman
dearly loved, a comrade and a friend, to unite
her life with his&mdash;for happiness and for sorrow,
for labour and for rest, ‘for better, for worse’ as
the English say. She had consented, and he
had returned to Carlsruhe, where his books,
papers and properties had been left.... But why
was he at Baden, you ask again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-12-</a></span></p>

<p>Well, he was at Baden, because Tatyana’s
aunt, who had brought her up, Kapitolina
Markovna Shestov, an old unmarried lady of fifty-five,
a most good-natured, honest, eccentric soul,
a free thinker, all aglow with the fire of self-sacrifice
and abnegation, an <i>esprit fort</i> (she
read Strauss, it is true she concealed the fact
from her niece) and a democrat, sworn opponent
of aristocracy and fashionable society, could
not resist the temptation of gazing for once on
this aristocratic society in such a fashionable
place as Baden.... Kapitolina Markovna
wore no crinoline and had her white hair cut
in a round crop, but luxury and splendour had
a secret fascination for her, and it was her
favourite pastime to rail at them and express
her contempt of them. How could one refuse
to gratify the good old lady? But Litvinov
was so quiet and simple, he gazed so self-confidently
about him, because his life lay so clearly
mapped out before him, because his career was
defined, and because he was proud of this career,
and rejoiced in it as the work of his own hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-13-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h2>


<p>‘Hullo! hullo! here he is!’ he suddenly
heard a squeaky voice just above his ear, and
a plump hand slapped him on the shoulder.
He lifted his head, and perceived one of his few
Moscow acquaintances, a certain Bambaev, a
good-natured but good-for-nothing fellow. He
was no longer young, he had a flabby nose and
soft cheeks, that looked as if they had been
boiled, dishevelled greasy locks, and a fat
squat person. Everlastingly short of cash,
and everlastingly in raptures over something,
Rostislav Bambaev wandered, aimless but exclamatory,
over the face of our long-suffering
mother-earth.</p>

<p>‘Well, this is something like a meeting!’ he
repeated, opening wide his sunken eyes, and
drawing down his thick lips, over which the
straggling dyed moustaches seemed strangely
out of place. ‘Ah, Baden! All the world runs
here like black-beetles! How did you come
here, Grisha?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-14-</a></span></p>

<p>There was positively no one in the world Bambaev
did not address by his Christian name.</p>

<p>‘I came here three days ago.’</p>

<p>‘From where?’</p>

<p>‘Why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘Why indeed? But stop, stop a minute,
Grisha. You are, perhaps, not aware who has
just arrived here! Gubaryov himself, in person!
That’s who’s here! He came yesterday
from Heidelberg. You know him of course?’</p>

<p>‘I have heard of him.’</p>

<p>‘Is that all? Upon my word! At once, this
very minute we will haul you along to him. Not
know a man like that! And by the way here’s
Voroshilov.... Stop a minute, Grisha, perhaps
you don’t know him either? I have the honour
to present you to one another. Both learned
men! He’s a phœnix indeed! Kiss each
other!’</p>

<p>And uttering these words, Bambaev turned
to a good-looking young man standing near him
with a fresh and rosy, but prematurely demure
face. Litvinov got up, and, it need hardly be
said, did not kiss him, but exchanged a cursory
bow with the phœnix, who, to judge from the
severity of his demeanour, was not overpleased
at this unexpected introduction.</p>

<p>‘I said a phœnix, and I will not go back
from my word,’ continued Bambaev; ‘go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-15-</a></span>
Petersburg, to the military school, and look at
the golden board; whose name stands first there?
The name of Voroshilov, Semyon Yakovlevitch!
But, Gubaryov, Gubaryov, my dear fellow!
It’s to him we must fly! I absolutely worship
that man! And I’m not alone, every one’s at
his feet! Ah, what a work he is writing, O&mdash;O&mdash;O!...’</p>

<p>‘What is his work about?’ inquired Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘About everything, my dear boy, after the
style of Buckle, you know ... but more profound,
more profound.... Everything will be
solved and made clear in it.’</p>

<p>‘And have you read this work yourself?’</p>

<p>‘No, I have not read it, and indeed it’s a
secret, which must not be spread about; but from
Gubaryov one may expect everything, everything!
Yes!’ Bambaev sighed and clasped his
hands. ‘Ah, if we had two or three intellects like
that growing up in Russia, ah, what mightn’t
we see then, my God! I tell you one thing,
Grisha; whatever pursuit you may have been
engaged in in these latter days&mdash;and I don’t even
know what your pursuits are in general&mdash;whatever
your convictions may be&mdash;I don’t know
them either&mdash;from him, Gubaryov, you will
find something to learn. Unluckily, he is not
here for long. We must make the most of him;
we must go. To him, to him!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-16-</a></span></p>

<p>A passing dandy with reddish curls and a blue
ribbon on his low hat, turned round and stared
through his eyeglass with a sarcastic smile at
Bambaev. Litvinov felt irritated.</p>

<p>‘What are you shouting for?’ he said; ‘one
would think you were hallooing dogs on at a
hunt! I have not had dinner yet.’</p>

<p>‘Well, think of that! we can go at once to
Weber’s ... the three of us ... capital! You
have the cash to pay for me?’ he added in an
undertone.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; only, I really don’t know&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Leave off, please; you will thank me for it,
and he will be delighted. Ah, heavens!’
Bambaev interrupted himself. ‘It’s the finale
from Ernani they’re playing. How delicious!...
<i>A som ... mo Carlo....</i> What a fellow I am,
though! In tears in a minute. Well, Semyon
Yakovlevitch! Voroshilov! shall we go, eh?’</p>

<p>Voroshilov, who had remained all the while
standing with immovable propriety, still maintaining
his former haughty dignity of demeanour,
dropped his eyes expressively, frowned,
and muttered something between his teeth ...
But he did not refuse; and Litvinov thought,
‘Well, we may as well do it, as I’ve plenty
of time on my hands.’ Bambaev took his
arm, but before turning towards the café he
beckoned to Isabelle the renowned flower-girl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-17-</a></span>
the Jockey Club: he had conceived the idea of
buying a bunch of flowers of her. But the
aristocratic flower-girl did not stir; and, indeed,
what should induce her to approach a gentleman
without gloves, in a soiled fustian jacket,
streaky cravat, and boots trodden down at
heel, whom she had not even seen in Paris?
Then Voroshilov in his turn beckoned to her.
To him she responded, and he, taking a tiny
bunch of violets from her basket, flung her a
florin. He thought to astonish her by his
munificence, but not an eyelash on her face
quivered, and when he had turned away, she
pursed up her mouth contemptuously. Voroshilov
was dressed very fashionably, even
exquisitely, but the experienced eye of the
Parisian girl noted at once in his get-up and in
his bearing, in his very walk, which showed
traces of premature military drill, the absence
of genuine, pure-blooded ‘chic.’</p>

<p>When they had taken their seats in the
principal dining-hall at Weber’s, and ordered
dinner, our friends fell into conversation.
Bambaev discoursed loudly and hotly upon the
immense importance of Gubaryov, but soon he
ceased speaking, and, gasping and chewing
noisily, drained off glass after glass. Voroshilov
<a id="TN_1">ate</a> and drank little, and as it were reluctantly,
and after questioning Litvinov as to the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-18-</a></span>
of his interests, fell to giving expression to
his own opinions&mdash;not so much on those
interests, as on questions of various kinds in
general.... All at once he warmed up, and
set off at a gallop like a spirited horse, boldly
and decisively assigning to every syllable, every
letter, its due weight, like a confident cadet going
up for his ‘final’ examination, with vehement,
but inappropriate gestures. At every instant,
since no one interrupted him, he became more
eloquent, more emphatic; it seemed as though
he were reading a dissertation or lecture. The
names of the most recent scientific authorities&mdash;with
the addition of the dates of the birth or death
of each of them&mdash;the titles of pamphlets that had
only just appeared, and names, names, names
... fell in showers together from his tongue,
affording himself intense satisfaction, reflected
in his glowing eyes. Voroshilov, seemingly,
despised everything old, and attached value
only to the cream of culture, the latest, most
advanced points of science; to mention, however
inappropriately, a book of some Doctor
Zauerbengel on Pennsylvanian prisons, or
yesterday’s articles in the <i>Asiatic Journal</i> on
the Vedas and Puranas (he pronounced it
<i>Journal</i> in the English fashion, though he
certainly did not know English) was for him
a real joy, a felicity. Litvinov listened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-19-</a></span>
listened to him, and could not make out what
could be his special line. At one moment his
talk was of the part played by the Celtic race
in history; then he was carried away to the
ancient world, and discoursed upon the Æginetan
marbles, harangued with great warmth
on the sculptor living earlier than Phidias,
Onetas, who was, however, transformed by
him into Jonathan, which lent his whole
discourse a half-Biblical, half-American flavour;
then he suddenly bounded away to political
economy and called Bastiat a fool or a blockhead,
‘as bad as Adam Smith and all the
physiocrats.’ ‘Physiocrats,’ murmured Bambaev
after him ... ‘aristocrats?’ Among
other things Voroshilov called forth an expression
of bewilderment on Bambaev’s face by
a criticism, dropped casually in passing, of
Macaulay, as an old-fashioned writer, superseded
by modern historical science; as for
Gneist, he declared he need scarcely refer to
him, and he shrugged his shoulders. Bambaev
shrugged his shoulders too. ‘And all this at
once, without any inducement, before strangers,
in a café’&mdash;Litvinov reflected, looking at the
fair hair, clear eyes, and white teeth of his
new acquaintance (he was specially embarrassed
by those large sugar-white teeth, and those
hands with their inappropriate gesticulations),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-20-</a></span>
‘and he doesn’t once smile; and with it all, he
would seem to be a nice lad, and absolutely
inexperienced.’ Voroshilov began to calm down
at last, his voice, youthfully resonant and shrill
as a young cock’s, broke a little.... Bambaev
seized the opportunity to declaim verses and
again nearly burst into tears, which scandalised
one table near them, round which was seated
an English family, and set another tittering;
two Parisian <i>cocottes</i> were dining at this second
table with a creature who resembled an ancient
baby in a wig. The waiter brought the bill;
the friends paid it.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ cried Bambaev, getting heavily up
from his chair, ‘now for a cup of coffee, and
quick march. There she is, our Russia,’ he
added, stopping in the doorway, and pointing
almost rapturously with his soft red hand to
Voroshilov and Litvinov.... ‘What do you
think of her?...’</p>

<p>‘Russia, indeed,’ thought Litvinov; and
Voroshilov, whose face had by now regained its
concentrated expression, again smiled condescendingly,
and gave a little tap with his heels.</p>

<p>Within five minutes they were all three mounting
the stairs of the hotel where Stepan Nikolaitch
Gubaryov was staying.... A tall slender
lady, in a hat with a short black veil, was
coming quickly down the same staircase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-21-</a></span>
Catching sight of Litvinov she turned suddenly
round to him, and stopped still as though
struck by amazement. Her face flushed
instantaneously, and then as quickly grew pale
under its thick lace veil; but Litvinov did
not observe her, and the lady ran down the
wide steps more quickly than before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-22-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h2>


<p>‘Grigory Litvinov, a brick, a true Russian
heart. I commend him to you,’ cried Bambaev,
conducting Litvinov up to a short man of
the figure of a country gentleman, with an
unbuttoned collar, in a short jacket, grey morning
trousers and slippers, standing in the
middle of a light, and very well-furnished room;
‘and this,’ he added, addressing himself to
Litvinov, ‘is he, the man himself, do you understand?
Gubaryov, then, in a word.’</p>

<p>Litvinov stared with curiosity at ‘the man
himself.’ He did not at first sight find in him
anything out of the common. He saw before
him a gentleman of respectable, somewhat dull
exterior, with a broad forehead, large eyes, full
lips, a big beard, and a thick neck, with a
fixed gaze, bent sidelong and downwards.
This gentleman simpered, and said, ‘Mmm ...
ah ... very pleased,...’ raised his hand to
his own face, and at once turning his back
on Litvinov, took a few paces upon the carpet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-23-</a></span>
with a slow and peculiar shuffle, as though he
were trying to slink along unseen. Gubaryov
had the habit of continually walking up and
down, and constantly plucking and combing
his beard with the tips of his long hard nails.
Besides Gubaryov, there was also in the room
a lady of about fifty, in a shabby silk dress,
with an excessively mobile face almost as
yellow as a lemon, a little black moustache on
her upper lip, and eyes which moved so quickly
that they seemed as though they were jumping
out of her head; there was too a broad-shouldered
man sitting bent up in a corner.</p>

<p>‘Well, honoured Matrona Semyonovna,’
began Gubaryov, turning to the lady, and
apparently not considering it necessary to
introduce Litvinov to her, ‘what was it you
were beginning to tell us?’</p>

<p>The lady (her name was Matrona Semyonovna
Suhantchikov&mdash;she was a widow, childless,
and not rich, and had been travelling from
country to country for two years past) began
with peculiar exasperated vehemence:</p>

<p>‘Well, so he appears before the prince and
says to him: “Your Excellency,” he says, “in
such an office and such a position as yours,
what will it cost you to alleviate my lot?
You,” he says, “cannot but respect the purity
of my ideas! And is it possible,” he says, “in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-24-</a></span>
these days to persecute a man for his ideas?”
And what do you suppose the prince did, that
cultivated dignitary in that exalted position?’</p>

<p>‘Why, what did he do?’ observed Gubaryov,
lighting a cigarette with a meditative air.</p>

<p>The lady drew herself up and held out her
bony right hand, with the first finger separated
from the rest.</p>

<p>‘He called his groom and said to him, “Take
off that man’s coat at once, and keep it yourself.
I make you a present of that coat!”’</p>

<p>‘And did the groom take it?’ asked Bambaev,
throwing up his arms.</p>

<p>‘He took it and kept it. And that was done
by Prince Barnaulov, the well-known rich
grandee, invested with special powers, the representative
of the government. What is one
to expect after that!’</p>

<p>The whole frail person of Madame Suhantchikov
was shaking with indignation, spasms
passed over her face, her withered bosom was
heaving convulsively under her flat corset; of
her eyes it is needless to speak, they were
fairly leaping out of her head. But then they
were always leaping, whatever she might be
talking about.</p>

<p>‘A crying shame, a crying shame!’ cried
Bambaev. ‘No punishment could be bad
enough!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-25-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Mmm.... Mmm.... From top to bottom
it’s all rotten,’ observed Gubaryov, without
raising his voice, however. ‘In that case punishment
is not ... that needs ... other measures.’</p>

<p>‘But is it really true?’ commented Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Is it true?’ broke in Madame Suhantchikov.
‘Why, that one can’t even dream of doubting
... can’t even d-d-d-ream of it.’ She pronounced
these words with such energy that she
was fairly shaking with the effort. ‘I was told
of that by a very trustworthy man. And you,
Stepan Nikolaitch, know him&mdash;Elistratov,
Kapiton. He heard it himself from eyewitnesses,
spectators of this disgraceful scene.’</p>

<p>‘What Elistratov?’ inquired Gubaryov. ‘The
one who was in Kazan?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I know, Stepan Nikolaitch, a rumour
was spread about him that he took bribes there
from some contractors or distillers. But then
who is it says so? Pelikanov! And how can one
believe Pelikanov, when every one knows he is
simply&mdash;a spy!’</p>

<p>‘No, with your permission, Matrona Semyonovna,’
interposed Bambaev, ‘I am friends
with Pelikanov, he is not a spy at all.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, that’s just what he is, a spy!’</p>

<p>‘But wait a minute, kindly&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘A spy, a spy!’ shrieked Madame Suhantchikov.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-26-</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, no, one minute, I tell you what,’ shrieked
Bambaev in his turn.</p>

<p>‘A spy, a spy,’ persisted Madame Suhantchikov.</p>

<p>‘No, no! There’s Tentelyev now, that’s a
different matter,’ roared Bambaev with all the
force of his lungs.</p>

<p>Madame Suhantchikov was silent for a
moment.</p>

<p>‘I know for a fact about that gentleman,’ he
continued in his ordinary voice, ‘that when he
was summoned before the secret police, he
grovelled at the feet of the Countess Blazenkrampff
and kept whining, “Save me, intercede
for me!” But Pelikanov never demeaned
himself to baseness like that.’</p>

<p>‘Mm ... Tentelyev ...’ muttered Gubaryov,
‘that ... that ought to be noted.’</p>

<p>Madame Suhantchikov shrugged her shoulders
contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘They’re one worse than another,’ she said,
‘but I know a still better story about Tentelyev.
He was, as every one knows, a most horrible
despot with his serfs, though he gave himself
out for an emancipator. Well, he was once at
some friend’s house in Paris, and suddenly in
comes Madame Beecher Stowe&mdash;you know,
<i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>. Tentelyev, who’s an awfully
pushing fellow, began asking the host to present
him; but directly she heard his name. “What?”
she said, “he presumes to be introduced to the
author of <i>Uncle Tom?</i>” And she gave him
a slap on the cheek! “Go away!” she says,
“at once!” And what do you think? Tentelyev
took his hat and slunk away, pretty
crestfallen.’</p>

</div>

<p>‘Come, I think that’s exaggerated,’ observed
Bambaev. ‘“Go away” she certainly did say,
that’s a fact, but she didn’t give him a smack!’</p>

<p>‘She did, she did!’ repeated Madam Suhantchikov
with convulsive intensity: ‘I am not
talking idle gossip. And you are friends with
men like that!’</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, excuse me, Matrona Semyonovna,
I never spoke of Tentelyev as a friend of
mine; I was speaking of Pelikanov.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if it’s not Tentelyev, it’s another.
Mihnyov, for example.’</p>

<p>‘What did he do then?’ asked Bambaev,
already showing signs of alarm.</p>

<p>‘What? Is it possible you don’t know? He
exclaimed on the Poznesensky Prospect in the
hearing of all the world that all the liberals
ought to be in prison; and what’s more, an
old schoolfellow came to him, a poor man
of course, and said, “Can I come to dinner
with you?” And this was his answer. “No,
impossible; I have two counts dining with me
to-day ... get along with you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-27-</a><br /><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-28-</a></span>”’</p>

<p>‘But that’s slander, upon my word!’ vociferated
Bambaev.</p>

<p>‘Slander? ... slander? In the first place,
Prince Vahrushkin, who was also dining at your
Mihnyov’s&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Prince Vahrushkin,’ Gubaryov interpolated
severely, ‘is my cousin; but I don’t allow him
to enter my house.... So there is no need
to mention him even.’</p>

<p>‘In the second place,’ continued Madame
Suhantchikov, with a submissive nod in Gubaryov’s
direction, ‘Praskovya <a id="TN_2">Yakovlovna</a> told me
so herself.’</p>

<p>‘You have hit on a fine authority to quote!
Why, she and Sarkizov are the greatest scandal-mongers
going.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, Sarkizov is a liar,
certainly. He filched the very pall of brocade
off his dead father’s coffin. I will never dispute
that; but Praskovya Yakovlovna&mdash;there’s no
comparison! Remember how magnanimously
she parted from her husband! But you, I
know, are always ready&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Come, enough, enough, Matrona Semyonovna,’
said Bambaev, interrupting her, ‘let
us give up this tittle-tattle, and take a loftier
flight. I am not new to the work, you
know. Have you read <i>Mlle. de la Quintinie?</i>
That’s something charming now! And quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-29-</a></span>
in accord with your principles at the same
time!’</p>

<p>‘I never read novels now,’ was Madame
Suhantchikov’s dry and sharp reply.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have not the time now; I have
no thoughts now but for one thing, sewing
machines.’</p>

<p>‘What machines?’ inquired Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Sewing, sewing; all women ought to provide
themselves with sewing-machines, and form
societies; in that way they will all be enabled to
earn their living, and will become independent
at once. In no other way can they ever be
emancipated. That is an important, most
important social question. I had such an argument
about it with Boleslav Stadnitsky. Boleslav
Stadnitsky is a marvellous nature, but he looks
at these things in an awfully frivolous spirit.
He does nothing but laugh. Idiot!’</p>

<p>‘All will in their due time be called to account,
from all it will be exacted,’ pronounced Gubaryov
deliberately, in a tone half-professorial,
half-prophetic.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ repeated Bambaev, ‘it will be
exacted, precisely so, it will be exacted. But,
Stepan Nikolaitch,’ he added, dropping his
voice, ‘how goes the great work?’</p>

<p>‘I am collecting materials,’ replied Gubaryov,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-30-</a></span>
knitting his brows; and, turning to Litvinov,
whose head began to swim from the medley of
unfamiliar names, and the frenzy of backbiting,
he asked him what subjects he was interested
in.</p>

<p>Litvinov satisfied his curiosity.</p>

<p>‘Ah! to be sure, the natural sciences. That
is useful, as training; as training, not as an end
in itself. The end at present should be ...
mm ... should be ... different. Allow me
to ask what views do you hold?’</p>

<p>‘What views?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that is, more accurately speaking, what
are your political views?’</p>

<p>Litvinov smiled.</p>

<p>‘Strictly speaking, I have no political views.’</p>

<p>The broad-shouldered man sitting in the
corner raised his head quickly at these words
and looked attentively at Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘How is that?’ observed Gubaryov with
peculiar gentleness. ‘Have you not yet reflected
on the subject, or have you grown weary
of it?’</p>

<p>‘How shall I say? It seems to me that for
us Russians, it is too early yet to have political
views or to imagine that we have them. Observe
that I attribute to the word “political”
the meaning which belongs to it by right, and
that&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-31-</a></span>&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Aha! he belongs to the undeveloped,’
Gubaryov interrupted him, with the same
gentleness, and going up to Voroshilov, he
asked him: ‘Had he read the pamphlet he had
given him?’</p>

<p>Voroshilov, to Litvinov’s astonishment, had
not uttered a word ever since his entrance, but
had only knitted his brows and rolled his eyes
(as a rule he was either speechifying or else perfectly
dumb). He now expanded his chest in
soldierly fashion, and with a tap of his heels,
nodded assent.</p>

<p>‘Well, and how was it? Did you like it?’</p>

<p>‘As regards the fundamental principles, I
liked it; but I did not agree with the inferences.’</p>

<p>‘Mmm ... Andrei Ivanitch praised that
pamphlet, however. You must expand your
doubts to me later.’</p>

<p>‘You desire it in writing?’</p>

<p>Gubaryov was obviously surprised; he had
not expected this; however, after a moment’s
thought, he replied:</p>

<p>‘Yes, in writing. By the way, I will ask you
to explain to me your views also ... in regard
to ... in regard to associations.’</p>

<p>‘Associations on Lassalle’s system, do you
desire, or on the system of Schulze-Delitzsch?’</p>

<p>‘Mmm ... on both. For us Russians, you
understand, the financial aspect of the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-32-</a></span>
is specially important. Yes, and the <i>artel</i> ...
as the germ.... All that, one must take note
of. One must go deeply into it. And the
question, too, of the land to be apportioned to
the peasants....’</p>

<p>‘And you, Stepan Nikolaitch, what is your
view as to the number of acres suitable?’ inquired
Voroshilov, with reverential delicacy in
his voice.</p>

<p>‘Mmm ... and the commune?’ articulated
Gubaryov, deep in thought, and biting a tuft of
his beard he stared at the table-leg. ‘The
commune!... Do you understand. That is a
grand word! Then what is the significance
of these conflagrations? these ... these
government measures against Sunday-schools,
reading-rooms, journals? And the refusal of
the peasants to sign the charters regulating their
position in the future? And finally, what of
what is happening in Poland? Don’t you see
that ... mmm ... that we ... we have to
unite with the people ... find out ... find out
their views&mdash;&mdash;’ Suddenly a heavy, almost a
wrathful emotion seemed to take possession of
Gubaryov; he even grew black in the face and
breathed heavily, but still did not raise his
eyes, and continued to gnaw at his beard.
‘Can’t you see&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Yevseyev is a wretch!’ Madame Suhantchikov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-33-</a></span>
burst out noisily all of a sudden. Bambaev
had been relating something to her in a voice
lowered out of respect for their host. Gubaryov
turned round swiftly on his heels, and again
began limping about the room.</p>

<p>Fresh guests began to arrive; towards the
end of the evening a good many people were
assembled. Among them came, too, Mr.
Yevseyev whom Madame Suhantchikov had
vilified so cruelly. She entered into conversation
with him very cordially, and asked him to
escort her home; there arrived too a certain
Pishtchalkin, an ideal mediator, one of those
men of precisely whom perhaps Russia stands
in need&mdash;a man, that is, narrow, of little information,
and no great gifts, but conscientious,
patient, and honest; the peasants of his district
almost worshipped him, and he regarded himself
very respectfully as a creature genuinely
deserving of esteem. A few officers, too, were
there, escaped for a brief furlough to Europe,
and rejoicing&mdash;though of course warily, and
ever mindful of their colonel in the background
of their brains&mdash;in the opportunity of
dallying a little with intellectual&mdash;even rather
dangerous&mdash;people; two lanky students from
Heidelberg came hurrying in, one looked about
him very contemptuously, the other giggled
spasmodically ... both were very ill at ease;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-34-</a></span>
after them a Frenchman&mdash;a so-called <i>petit jeune
homme</i>&mdash;poked his nose in; a nasty, silly,
pitiful little creature, ... who enjoyed some
repute among his fellow <i>commis-voyageurs</i> on
the theory that Russian countesses had fallen
in love with him; for his own part, his reflections
were centred more upon getting a supper
gratis; the last to appear was Tit Bindasov, in
appearance a rollicking German student, in
reality a skinflint, in words a terrorist, by
vocation a police-officer, a friend of Russian
merchants’ wives and Parisian <i>cocottes;</i> bald,
toothless, and drunken; he arrived very red
and sodden, affirming that he had lost his last
farthing to that blackguard Benazet; in reality,
he had won sixteen guldens.... In short,
there were a number of people. Remarkable&mdash;really
remarkable&mdash;was the respect with which
all these people treated Gubaryov as a preceptor
or chief; they laid their ideas before him, and
submitted them to his judgment; and he
replied by muttering, plucking at his beard,
averting his eyes, or by some disconnected,
meaningless words, which were at once seized
upon as the utterances of the loftiest wisdom.
Gubaryov himself seldom interposed in the
discussions; but the others strained their lungs
to the utmost to make up for it. It happened
more than once that three or four were shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-35-</a></span>
for ten minutes together, and all were content
and understood. The conversation lasted till
after midnight, and was as usual distinguished
by the number and variety of the subjects
discussed. Madame Suhantchikov talked about
Garibaldi, about a certain Karl Ivanovitch,
who had been flogged by the serfs of his own
household, about Napoleon <span class="smaller">III.</span>, about women’s
work, about a merchant, Pleskatchov, who had
designedly caused the death of twelve work-women,
and had received a medal for it with
the inscription ‘for public services’; about
the proletariat, about the Georgian Prince
Tchuktcheulidzov, who had shot his wife with
a cannon, and about the future of Russia.
Pishtchalkin, too, talked of the future of Russia,
and of the spirit monopoly, and of the significance
of nationalities, and of how he hated above
everything what was vulgar. There was an outburst
all of a sudden from Voroshilov; in a
single breath, almost choking himself, he mentioned
Draper, Virchow, Shelgunov, Bichat,
Helmholtz, Star, St. Raymund, Johann Müller
the physiologist, and Johann Müller the historian&mdash;obviously
confounding them&mdash;Taine, Renan,
Shtchapov; and then Thomas Nash, Peele,
Greene.... ‘What sort of queer fish may they
be?’ Bambaev muttered bewildered, Shakespeare’s
predecessors having the same relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-36-</a></span>
to him as the ranges of the Alps to Mont Blanc.
Voroshilov replied cuttingly, and he too touched
on the future of Russia. Bambaev also spoke
of the future of Russia, and even depicted it in
glowing colours: but he was thrown into special
raptures over the thought of Russian music, in
which he saw something. ‘Ah! great indeed!’
and in confirmation he began humming a song
of Varlamov’s, but was soon interrupted by a
general shout, ‘He is singing the <i>Miserere</i> from
the <i>Trovatore</i>, and singing it excruciatingly too.’
One little officer was reviling Russian literature
in the midst of the hubbub; another was quoting
verses from <i>Sparks;</i> but Tit Bindasov
went even further; he declared that all these
swindlers ought to have their teeth knocked
out, ... and that’s all about it, but he did not
particularise who were the swindlers alluded to.
The smoke from the cigars became stifling; all
were hot and exhausted, every one was hoarse,
all eyes were growing dim, and the perspiration
stood out in drops on every face. Bottles of
iced beer were brought in and drunk off instantaneously.
‘What was I saying?’ remarked
one; ‘and with whom was I disputing, and
about what?’ inquired another. And among
all the uproar and the smoke, Gubaryov walked
indefatigably up and down as before, swaying
from side to side and twitching at his beard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-37-</a></span>
now listening, turning an ear to some controversy,
now putting in a word of his own; and
every one was forced to feel that he, Gubaryov,
was the source of it all, that he was the master
here, and the most eminent personality....</p>

<p>Litvinov, towards ten o’clock, began to have
a terrible headache, and, taking advantage of
a louder outburst of general excitement, went
off quietly unobserved. Madame Suhantchikov
had recollected a fresh act of injustice of Prince
Barnaulov; he had all but given orders to have
some one’s ears bitten off.</p>

<p>The fresh night air enfolded Litvinov’s flushed
face caressingly, the fragrant breeze breathed
on his parched lips. ‘What is it,’ he thought
as he went along the dark avenue, ‘that I have
been present at? Why were they met together?
What were they shouting, scolding, and making
such a pother about? What was it all for?’
Litvinov shrugged his shoulders, and turning
into Weber’s, he picked up a newspaper and
asked for an ice. The newspaper was taken
up with a discussion on the Roman question,
and the ice turned out to be very nasty. He
was already preparing to go home, when
suddenly an unknown person in a wide-brimmed
hat drew near, and saying in Russian:
‘I hope I am not in your way?’ sat down at
his table. Only then, after a closer glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-38-</a></span>
the stranger, Litvinov recognised him as the
broad-shouldered gentleman hidden away in a
corner at Gubaryov’s, who had stared at him
with such attention when the conversation had
turned on political views. During the whole
evening this gentleman had not once opened
his mouth, and now, sitting down near Litvinov,
and taking off his hat, he looked at him with
an expression of friendliness and some embarrassment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-39-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="V" id="V">V</a></h2>


<p>‘Mr. Gubaryov, at whose rooms I had the
pleasure of meeting you to-day,’ he began, ‘did
not introduce me to you; so that, with your
leave, I will now introduce myself&mdash;Potugin,
retired councillor. I was in the department of
finances in St. Petersburg. I hope you do not
think it strange.... I am not in the habit as
a rule of making friends so abruptly ... but
with you....’</p>

<p>Potugin grew rather mixed, and he
asked the waiter to bring him a little glass of
kirsch-wasser. ‘To give me courage,’ he added
with a smile.</p>

<p>Litvinov looked with redoubled interest at
the last of all the new persons with whom it
had been his lot to be brought into contact that
day. His thought was at once, ‘He is not
the same as those.’</p>

<p>Certainly he was not. There sat before him,
drumming with delicate fingers on the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-40-</a></span>
the table, a broad-shouldered man, with an
ample frame on short legs, a downcast head of
curly hair, with very intelligent and very mournful
eyes under bushy brows, a thick well-cut
mouth, bad teeth, and that purely Russian nose
to which is assigned the epithet ‘potato’; a
man of awkward, even odd exterior; at least,
he was certainly not of a common type. He
was carelessly dressed; his old-fashioned coat
hung on him like a sack, and his cravat was
twisted awry. His sudden friendliness, far from
striking Litvinov as intrusive, secretly flattered
him; it was impossible not to see that it was
not a common practice with this man to attach
himself to strangers. He made a curious impression
on Litvinov; he awakened in him
respect and liking, and a kind of involuntary
compassion.</p>

<p>‘I am not in your way then?’ he repeated in
a soft, rather languid and faint voice, which was
marvellously in keeping with his whole personality.</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ replied Litvinov; ‘quite the
contrary, I am very glad.’</p>

<p>‘Really? Well, then, I am glad too. I have
heard a great deal about you; I know what
you are engaged in, and what your plans are.
It’s a good work. That’s why you were silent
this evening.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-41-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes; you too said very little, I fancy,’ observed
Litvinov.</p>

<p>Potugin sighed. ‘The others said enough and
to spare. I listened. Well,’ he added, after
a moment’s pause, raising his eyebrows with
a rather humorous expression, ‘did you like
our building of the Tower of Babel?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just what it was. You have expressed
it capitally. I kept wanting to ask those gentlemen
what they were in such a fuss about.’</p>

<p>Potugin sighed again.</p>

<p>‘That’s the whole point of it, that they don’t
know that themselves. In former days the
expression used about them would have been:
“they are the blind instruments of higher ends”;
well, nowadays we make use of sharper epithets.
And take note that I am not in the least intending
to blame them; I will say more, they
are all ... that is, almost all, excellent people.
Of Madame Suhantchikov, for instance, I know
for certain much that is good; she gave away
the last of her fortune to two poor nieces. Even
admitting that the desire of doing something
picturesque, of showing herself off, was not
without its influence on her, still you will agree
that it was a remarkable act of self-sacrifice in
a woman not herself well-off! Of Mr. Pishtchalkin
there is no need to speak even; the
peasants of his district will certainly in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-42-</a></span>
present him with a silver bowl like a pumpkin,
and perhaps even a holy picture representing
his patron saint, and though he will tell them
in his speech of thanks that he does not deserve
such an honour, he won’t tell the truth there;
he does deserve it. Mr. Bambaev, your friend,
has a wonderfully good heart; it’s true that it’s
with him as with the poet Yazikov, who they
say used to sing the praises of Bacchic revelry,
sitting over a book and sipping water; his
enthusiasm is completely without a special
object, still it is enthusiasm; and Mr. Voroshilov,
too, is the most good-natured fellow; like all
his sort, all men who’ve taken the first prizes
at school, he’s an <i>aide-de-camp</i> of the sciences,
and he even holds his tongue sententiously, but
then he is so young. Yes, yes, they are all excellent
people, and when you come to results,
there’s nothing to show for it; the ingredients
are all first-rate, but the dish is not worth
eating.’</p>

<p>Litvinov listened to Potugin with growing
astonishment: every phrase, every turn of his
slow but self-confident speech betrayed both
the power of speaking and the desire to
speak.</p>

<p>Potugin did, in fact, like speaking, and could
speak well; but, as a man in whom life had
succeeded in wearing away vanity, he waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-43-</a></span>
with philosophic calm for a good opportunity, a
meeting with a kindred spirit.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ he began again, with the special
dejected but not peevish humour peculiar to
him, ‘it is all very strange. And there is something
else I want you to note. Let a dozen
Englishmen, for example, come together, and
they will at once begin to talk of the sub-marine
telegraph, or the tax on paper, or a
method of tanning rats’ skins,&mdash;of something,
that’s to say, practical and definite; a dozen
Germans, and of course Schleswig-Holstein
and the unity of Germany will be brought on
the scene; given a dozen Frenchmen, and the
conversation will infallibly turn upon amorous
adventures, however much you try to divert
them from the subject; but let a dozen Russians
meet together, and instantly there springs up
the question&mdash;you had an opportunity of being
convinced of the fact this evening&mdash;the question
of the significance and the future of Russia,
and in terms so general, beginning with creation,
without facts or conclusions. They worry and
worry away at that unlucky subject, as children
chew away at a bit of india-rubber&mdash;neither
for pleasure nor profit, as the saying is. Well,
then, of course the rotten West comes in
for its share. It’s a curious thing, it beats
us at every point, this West&mdash;but yet we declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-44-</a></span>
that it’s rotten! And if only we had a genuine
contempt for it,’ pursued Potugin, ‘but that’s
really all cant and humbug. We can do well
enough as far as abuse goes, but the opinion of
the West is the only thing we value, the opinion,
that’s to say, of the Parisian loafers.... I know
a man&mdash;a good fellow, I fancy&mdash;the father of
a family, and no longer young; he was thrown
into deep dejection for some days because in a
Parisian restaurant he had asked for <i>une portion
de biftek aux pommes de terre</i>, and a real Frenchman
thereupon shouted: <i>Garçon! biftek pommes!</i>
My friend was ready to die with shame, and after
that he shouted everywhere, <i>Biftek pommes!</i> and
taught others to do the same. The very <i>cocottes</i>
are surprised at the reverential trepidation with
which our young barbarians enter their shameful
drawing-rooms. “Good God!” they are
thinking, “is this really where I am, with no
less a person than Anna Deslions herself!”’</p>

<p>‘Tell me, pray,’ continued Litvinov, ‘to what
do you ascribe the influence Gubaryov undoubtedly
has over all about him? Is it his talent,
his abilities?’</p>

<p>‘No, no; there is nothing of that sort about
him....’</p>

<p>‘His personal character is it, then?’</p>

<p>‘Not that either, but he has a strong will.
We Slavs, for the most part, as we all know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-45-</a></span>
are badly off for that commodity, and we grovel
before it. It is Mr. Gubaryov’s will to be a ruler,
and every one has recognised him as a ruler.
What would you have? The government
has freed us from the dependence of serfdom&mdash;and
many thanks to it! but the habits of
slavery are too deeply ingrained in us; we cannot
easily be rid of them. We want a master
in everything and everywhere; as a rule this
master is a living person, sometimes it is some
so-called tendency which gains authority over
us.... At present, for instance, we are all the
bondslaves of natural science.... Why, owing
to what causes, we take this bondage upon us,
that is a matter difficult to see into; but such
seemingly is our nature. But the great thing
is, that we should have a master. Well, here he
is amongst us; that means he is ours, and we
can afford to despise everything else! Simply
slaves! And our pride is slavish, and slavish
too is our humility. If a new master arises&mdash;it’s
all over with the old one. Then it was
Yakov, and now it is Sidor; we box Yakov’s
ears and kneel to Sidor! Call to mind how
many tricks of that sort have been played
amongst us! We talk of scepticism as our
special characteristic; but even in our scepticism
we are not like a free man fighting with a sword,
but like a lackey hitting out with his fist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-46-</a></span>
very likely he is doing even that at his master’s
bidding. Then, we are a soft people too; it’s
not difficult to keep the curb on us. So that’s
the way Mr. Gubaryov has become a power
among us; he has chipped and chipped away
at one point, till he has chipped himself into
success. People see that he is a man who has
a great opinion of himself, who believes in himself,
and commands. That’s the great thing,
that he can command; it follows that he must
be right, and we ought to obey him. All
our sects, our Onuphrists and Akulinists, were
founded exactly in that way. He who holds
the rod is the corporal.’</p>

<p>Potugin’s cheeks were flushed and his eyes
grew dim; but, strange to say, his speech, cruel
and even malicious as it was, had no touch of
bitterness, but rather of sorrow, genuine and
sincere sorrow.</p>

<p>‘How did you come to know Gubaryov?’
asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘I have known him a long while. And
observe, another peculiarity among us; a certain
writer, for example, spent his whole life in
inveighing in prose and verse against drunkenness,
and attacking the system of the drink
monopoly, and lo and behold! he went and
bought two spirit distilleries and opened a hundred
drink-shops&mdash;and it made no difference!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-47-</a></span>
Any other man might have been wiped off the
face of the earth, but he was not even reproached
for it. And here is Mr. Gubaryov; he is a Slavophil
and a democrat and a socialist and anything
you like, but his property has been and is still
managed by his brother, a master of the old
style, one of those who were famous for their
fists. And the very Madame Suhantchikov,
who makes Mrs. Beecher Stowe box Tentelyev’s
ears, is positively in the dust before
Gubaryov’s feet. And you know the only
thing he has to back him is that he reads clever
books, and always gets at the pith of them.
You could see for yourself to-day what sort of
gift he has for expression; and thank God, too,
that he does talk little, and keeps in his shell.
For when he is in good spirits, and lets himself go,
then it’s more than even I, patient as I am, can
stand. He begins by coarse joking and telling
filthy anecdotes ... yes, really, our majestic Mr.
Gubaryov tells filthy anecdotes, and guffaws
so revoltingly over them all the time.’</p>

<p>‘Are you so patient?’ observed Litvinov. ‘I
should have supposed the contrary. But let me
ask your name and your father’s name?’</p>

<p>Potugin sipped a little kirsch-wasser.</p>

<p>‘My name is Sozont.... Sozont Ivanitch.
They gave me that magnificent name in honour
of a kinsman, an archimandrite, to whom I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-48-</a></span>
indebted for nothing else. I am, if I may venture
so to express myself, of most reverend
stock. And as for your doubts about my
patience, they are quite groundless: I am very
patient. I served for twenty-two years under
the authority of my own uncle, an actual councillor
of state, Irinarh Potugin. You don’t know
him?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘I congratulate you. No, I am patient. “But
let us return to our first head,” as my esteemed
colleague, who was burned alive some centuries
ago, the protopope Avvakum, used to say. I am
amazed, my dear sir, at my fellow-countrymen.
They are all depressed, they all walk with downcast
heads, and at the same time they are all filled
with hope, and on the smallest excuse they lose
their heads and fly off into ecstasies. Look at
the Slavophils even, among whom Mr. Gubaryov
reckons himself: they are most excellent people,
but there is the same mixture of despair and
exultation, they too live in the future tense.
Everything will be, will be, if you please. In
reality there is nothing done, and Russia for
ten whole centuries has created nothing of its
own, either in government, in law, in science, in
art, or even in handicraft.... But wait a little,
have patience; it is all coming. And why is
it coming; give us leave to inquire? Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-49-</a></span>
because we, to be sure, the cultured classes are
all worthless; but the people.... Oh, the great
people! You see that peasant’s smock? That
is the source that everything is to come from.
All the other idols have broken down; let us
have faith in the smock-frock. Well, but suppose
the smock-frock fails us? No, it will not
fail. Read Kohanovsky, and cast your eyes up
to heaven! Really, if I were a painter, I would
paint a picture of this sort: a cultivated man
standing before a peasant, doing him homage:
heal me, dear master-peasant, I am perishing of
disease; and a peasant doing homage in his turn
to the cultivated man: teach me, dear master-gentleman,
I am perishing from ignorance.
Well, and of course, both are standing still.
But what we ought to do is to feel really
humble for a little&mdash;not only in words&mdash;and
to borrow from our elder brothers what they
have invented already before us and better than
us! Waiter, <i>noch ein Gläschen Kirsch!</i> You
mustn’t think I’m a drunkard, but alcohol
loosens my tongue.’</p>

<p>‘After what you have just said,’ observed
Litvinov with a smile, ‘I need not even inquire
to which party you belong, and what is your
opinion about Europe. But let me make one
observation to you. You say that we ought to
borrow from our elder brothers: but how can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-50-</a></span>
we borrow without consideration of the conditions
of climate and of soil, the local and national
peculiarities? My father, I recollect, ordered
from Butenop a cast-iron thrashing machine
highly recommended; the machine was very
good, certainly&mdash;but what happened? For five
long years it remained useless in the barn, till it
was replaced by a wooden American one&mdash;far
more suitable to our ways and habits, as the
American machines are as a rule. One cannot
borrow at random, Sozont Ivanitch.’</p>

<p>Potugin lifted his head.</p>

<p>‘I did not expect such a criticism as that
from you, excellent Grigory Mihalovitch,’ he
began, after a moment’s pause. ‘Who wants to
make you borrow at random? Of course you
steal what belongs to another man, not because
it is some one else’s, but because it suits you; so
it follows that you consider, you make a selection.
And as for results, pray don’t let us be unjust
to ourselves; there will be originality enough
in them by virtue of those very local, climatic,
and other conditions which you mention. Only
lay good food before it, and the natural stomach
will digest it in its own way; and in time, as
the organism gains in vigour, it will give it a
sauce of its own. Take our language even as
an instance. Peter the Great deluged it with
thousands of foreign words, Dutch, French, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-51-</a></span>
German; those words expressed ideas with
which the Russian people had to be familiarised;
without scruple or ceremony Peter poured
them wholesale by bucketsful into us. At first,
of course, the result was something of a monstrous
product; but later there began precisely that
process of digestion to which I have alluded.
The ideas had been introduced and assimilated;
the foreign forms evaporated gradually, and the
language found substitutes for them from within
itself; and now your humble servant, the most
mediocre stylist, will undertake to translate any
page you like out of Hegel&mdash;yes, indeed, out of
Hegel&mdash;without making use of a single word
not Slavonic. What has happened with the
language, one must hope will happen in other
departments. It all turns on the question: is it
a nature of strong vitality? and our nature&mdash;well,
it will stand the test; it has gone through
greater trials than that. Only nations in a state
of nervous debility, feeble nations, need fear for
their health and their independence, just as it is
only weak-minded people who are capable of
falling into triumphant rhapsodies over the fact
that we are Russians. I am very careful over
my health, but I don’t go into ecstasies over it:
I should be ashamed.’</p>

<p>‘That is all very true, Sozont Ivanitch,’ observed
Litvinov in his turn; ‘but why inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">-52-</a></span>
expose ourselves to such tests? You say yourself
that at first the result was monstrous!
Well, what if that monstrous product had persisted?
Indeed it has persisted, as you know
yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Only not in the language&mdash;and that means
a great deal! And it is our people, not I, who
have done it; I am not to blame because they
are destined to go through a discipline of this
kind. “The Germans have developed in a
normal way,” cry the Slavophils, “let us too
have a normal development!” But how are
you to get it when the very first historical step
taken by our race&mdash;the summoning of a prince
from over the sea to rule over them&mdash;is an
irregularity, an abnormality, which is repeated
in every one of us down to the present day;
each of us, at least once in his life, has certainly
said to something foreign, not Russian:
“Come, rule and reign over me!” I am ready,
of course, to agree that when we put a foreign
substance into our own body we cannot tell for
certain what it is we are putting there, bread or
poison; yet it is a well-known thing that you
can never get from bad to good through what
is better, but always through a worse state of
transition, and poison too is useful in medicine.
It is only fit for fools or knaves to point with
triumph to the poverty of the peasants after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-53-</a></span>
emancipation, and the increase of drunkenness
since the abolition of the farming of the spirit-tax....
Through worse to better!’</p>

<p>Potugin passed his hand over his face. ‘You
asked me what was my opinion of Europe,’ he
began again: ‘I admire her, and am devoted to
her principles to the last degree, and don’t in
the least think it necessary to conceal the fact.
I have long&mdash;no, not long&mdash;for some time ceased
to be afraid to give full expression to my convictions&mdash;and
I saw that you too had no
hesitation in informing Mr. Gubaryov of your
own way of thinking. Thank God I have
given up paying attention to the ideas and
points of view and habits of the man I am conversing
with. Really, I know of nothing worse
than that quite superfluous cowardice, that
cringing desire to be agreeable, by virtue of
which you may see an important dignitary
among us trying to ingratiate himself with
some little student who is quite insignificant
in his eyes, positively playing down to him, with
all sorts of tricks and devices. Even if we
admit that the dignitary may do it out of desire
for popularity, what induces us common folk to
shuffle and degrade ourselves. Yes, yes, I am
a Westerner, I am devoted to Europe: that’s to
say, speaking more accurately, I am devoted to
culture&mdash;the culture at which they make fun so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-54-</a></span>
wittily among us just now&mdash;and to civilisation&mdash;yes,
yes, that is a better word&mdash;and I love it
with my whole heart and believe in it, and I
have no other belief, and never shall have. That
word, ci-vi-li-sa-tion (Potugin pronounced each
syllable with full stress and emphasis), is
intelligible, and pure, and holy, and all the
other ideals, nationality, glory, or what you like&mdash;they
smell of blood.... Away with them!’</p>

<p>‘Well, but Russia, Sozont Ivanitch, your
country&mdash;you love it?’</p>

<p>Potugin passed his hand over his face. ‘I
love her passionately and passionately hate her.’</p>

<p>Litvinov shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘That’s stale, Sozont Ivanitch, that’s a
commonplace.’</p>

<p>‘And what of it? So that’s what you’re
afraid of! A commonplace! I know many
excellent commonplaces. Here, for example,
Law and Liberty is a well-known commonplace.
Why, do you consider it’s better as it is
with us, lawlessness and bureaucratic tyranny?
And, besides, all those phrases by which so
many young heads are turned: vile bourgeoisie,
<i>souveraineté du peuple</i>, right to labour, aren’t
they commonplaces too? And as for love,
inseparable from hate....’</p>

<p>‘Byronism,’ interposed Litvinov, ‘the romanticism
of the thirties.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-55-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Excuse me, you’re mistaken; such a mingling
of emotions was first mentioned by Catullus,
the Roman poet Catullus,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> two thousand years
ago. I have read that, for I know a little
Latin, thanks to my clerical origin, if so I may
venture to express myself. Yes, indeed, I both
love and hate my Russia, my strange, sweet,
nasty, precious country. I have left her just
now. I want a little fresh air after sitting for
twenty years on a clerk’s high stool in a government
office; I have left Russia, and I am
happy and contented here; but I shall soon go
back again: I feel that. It’s a beautiful land of
gardens&mdash;but our wild berries will not grow
here.’</p>

<p>‘You are happy and contented, and I too
like the place,’ said Litvinov, ‘and I came here
to study; but that does not prevent me from
seeing things like that.’</p>

<p>He pointed to two <i>cocottes</i> who passed
by, attended by a little group of members of
the Jockey Club, grimacing and lisping, and to
the gambling saloon, full to overflowing in spite
of the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>‘And who told you I am blind to that?’
Potugin broke in. ‘But pardon my saying it,
your remark reminds me of the triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-56-</a></span>
allusions made by our unhappy journalists at
the time of the Crimean war, to the defects in
the English War Department, exposed in the
<i>Times</i>. I am not an optimist myself, and all
humanity, all our life, all this comedy with
tragic issues presents itself to me in no roseate
colours: but why fasten upon the West what is
perhaps ingrained in our very human nature?
That gambling hall is disgusting, certainly;
but is our home-bred card-sharping any lovelier,
think you? No, my dear Grigory Mihalovitch,
let us be more humble, more retiring. A good
pupil sees his master’s faults, but he keeps a
respectful silence about them; these very
faults are of use to him, and set him on the
right path. But if nothing will satisfy you but
sharpening your teeth on the unlucky West,
there goes Prince Kokó at a gallop, he will most
likely lose in a quarter of an hour over the green
table the hardly earned rent wrung from a hundred
and fifty families; his nerves are upset, for
I saw him at Marx’s to-day turning over a pamphlet
of Vaillot.... He will be a capital person
for you to talk to!’</p>

<p>‘But, please, please,’ said Litvinov hurriedly,
seeing that Potugin was getting up from his
place, ‘I know Prince Kokó very little, and
besides, of course, I greatly prefer talking to you.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks very much,’ Potugin interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-57-</a></span>
him, getting up and making a bow; ‘but I have
already had a good deal of conversation with
you; that’s to say, really, I have talked alone,
and you have probably noticed yourself that a
man is always as it were ashamed and awkward
when he has done all the talking, especially so
on a first meeting, as if to show what a fine
fellow one is. Good-bye for the present. And
I repeat I am very glad to have made your
acquaintance.’</p>

<p>‘But wait a minute, Sozont Ivanitch, tell me
at least where you live, and whether you intend
to remain here long.’</p>

<p>Potugin seemed a little put out.</p>

<p>‘I shall remain about a week in Baden. We
can meet here though, at Weber’s or at Marx’s,
or else I will come to you.’</p>

<p>‘Still I must know your address.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. But you see I am not alone.’</p>

<p>‘You are married?’ asked Litvinov suddenly.</p>

<p>‘No, good heavens! ... what an absurd idea!
But I have a girl with me.’...</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ articulated Litvinov, with a face of
studied politeness, as though he would ask
pardon, and he dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>‘She is only six years old,’ pursued Potugin.
‘She’s an orphan ... the daughter of a lady ...
a good friend of mine. So we had better meet
here. Good-bye.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-58-</a></span></p>

<p>He pulled his hat over his curly head, and
disappeared quickly. Twice there was a
glimpse of him under the gas-lamps in the
rather meanly lighted road that leads into the
Lichtenthaler Allee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">-59-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a></h2>


<p>‘A strange man!’ thought Litvinov, as he
turned into the hotel where he was staying;
‘a strange man! I must see more of him!’
He went into his room; a letter on the table
caught his eye. ‘Ah! from Tanya!’ he thought,
and was overjoyed at once; but the letter was
from his country place, from his father. Litvinov
broke the thick heraldic seal, and was
just setting to work to read it ... when he was
struck by a strong, very agreeable, and familiar
fragrance, and saw in the window a great bunch
of fresh heliotrope in a glass of water. Litvinov
bent over them not without amazement, touched
them, and smelt them.... Something seemed
to stir in his memory, something very remote ...
but what, precisely, he could not discover. He
rang for the servant and asked him where these
flowers had come from. The man replied that
they had been brought by a lady who would
not give her name, but said that ‘Herr Zlitenhov’
would be sure to guess who she was by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-60-</a></span>
flowers. Again something stirred in Litvinov’s
memory. He asked the man what the lady
looked like, and the servant informed him that
she was tall and grandly dressed and had a
veil over her face. ‘A Russian countess most
likely,’ he added.</p>

<p>‘What makes you think that?’ asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘She gave me two guldens,’ responded the
servant with a grin.</p>

<p>Litvinov dismissed him, and for a long while
after he stood in deep thought before the
window; at last, however, with a wave of his
hand, he began again upon the letter from the
country. His father poured out to him his
usual complaints, asserting that no one would
take their corn, even for nothing, that the people
had got quite out of all habits of obedience, and
that probably the end of the world was coming
soon. ‘Fancy,’ he wrote, among other things,
‘my last coachman, the Kalmuck boy, do you
remember him? has been bewitched, and the
fellow would certainly have died, and I should
have had none to drive me, but, thank goodness,
some kind folks suggested and advised to send
the sick man to Ryazan, to a priest, well-known
as a master against witchcraft: and his
cure has actually succeeded as well as possible,
in confirmation of which I lay before you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">-61-</a></span>
letter of the good father as a document.’
Litvinov ran through this document with curiosity.
In it was set forth: ‘that the serving-man
Nicanor Dmitriev was beset with a malady
which could not be touched by the medical
faculty; and this malady was the work of
wicked people; but he himself, Nicanor, was
the cause of it, since he had not fulfilled his
promise to a certain girl, and therefore by the aid
of others she had made him unfit for anything,
and if I had not appeared to aid him in these
circumstances, he would surely have perished
utterly, like a worm; but I, trusting in the
All-seeing Eye, have become a stay to him in
his life; and how I accomplished it, that is a
mystery; I beg your excellency not to countenance
a girl who has such wicked arts, and
even to chide her would be no harm, or she
may again work him a mischief.’</p>

<p>Litvinov fell to musing over this document;
it brought him a whiff of the desert, of the
steppes, of the blind darkness of the life mouldering
there, and it seemed a marvellous thing
that he should be reading such a letter in
Baden, of all places. Meanwhile it had long
struck midnight; Litvinov went to bed and
put out his light. But he could not get to
sleep; the faces he had seen, the talk he had
heard, kept coming back and revolving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-62-</a></span>
strangely interwoven and entangled in his
burning head, which ached from the fumes of
tobacco. Now he seemed to hear Gubaryov’s
muttering, and fancied his eyes with their dull,
persistent stare fastened on the floor; then
suddenly those eyes began to glow and leap,
and he recognised Madame Suhantchikov, and
listened to her shrill voice, and involuntarily
repeated after her in a whisper, ‘she did, she
did, slap his face.’ Then the clumsy figure of
Potugin passed before him; and for the tenth,
and the twentieth time he went over every
word he had uttered; then, like a jack in the
box, Voroshilov jumped up in his trim coat,
which fitted him like a new uniform; and
Pishtchalkin gravely and sagaciously nodded
his well-cut and truly well-intentioned head;
and then Bindasov bawled and swore, and
Bambaev fell into tearful transports.... And
above all&mdash;this scent, this persistent, sweet,
heavy scent gave him no rest, and grew more
and more powerful in the darkness, and more
and more importunately it reminded him of
something which still eluded his grasp.... The
idea occurred to Litvinov that the scent of
flowers at night in a bedroom was injurious, and
he got up, and groping his way to the nosegay,
carried it into the next room; but even from
there the oppressive fragrance penetrated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-63-</a></span>
him on his pillow and under the counterpane,
and he tossed in misery from side to side. A
slight delirium had already begun to creep over
him; already the priest, ‘the master against
witchcraft’ had twice run across his road in the
guise of a very playful hare with a beard and a
pig-tail, and Voroshilov was trilling before him,
sitting in a huge general’s plumed cock-hat like
a nightingale in a bush.... When suddenly
he jumped up in bed, and clasping his hands,
cried, ‘Can it be she? it can’t be!’</p>

<p>But to explain this exclamation of Litvinov’s
we must beg the indulgent reader to go back
a few years with us.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a></h2>


<p>Early in the fifties, there was living in Moscow,
in very straitened circumstances, almost in
poverty, the numerous family of the Princes
Osinin. These were real princes&mdash;not Tartar-Georgians,
but pure-blooded descendants of
Rurik. Their name is often to be met with in
our chronicles under the first grand princes of
Moscow, who created a united Russia. They
possessed wide acres and many domains. Many
a time they were rewarded for ‘service and
blood and disablement.’ They sat in the Council
of Boyars. One of them even rose to a very
high position. But they fell under the ban of
the empire through the plots of enemies ‘on a
charge of witchcraft and evil philtres,’ and they
were ruined ‘terribly and beyond recall.’ They
were deprived of their rank, and banished to remote
parts; the Osinins fell and had never risen
again, had never attained to power again. The
ban was taken off in time, and they were even
reinstated in their Moscow house and belongings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-65-</a></span>
but it was of no avail. Their family was
impoverished, ‘run to seed’; it did not revive
under Peter, nor under Catherine; and constantly
dwindling and growing humbler, it had
by now reckoned private stewards, managers of
wine-shops, and ward police-inspectors among its
members. The family of Osinins, of whom we
have made mention, consisted of a husband and
wife and five children. It was living near the
Dogs’ Place, in a one-storied little wooden house,
with a striped portico looking on to the street,
green lions on the gates, and all the other
pretensions of nobility, though it could hardly
make both ends meet, was constantly in debt
at the green-grocer’s, and often sitting without
firewood or candles in the winter. The prince
himself was a dull, indolent man, who had once
been a handsome dandy, but had gone to seed
completely. More from regard for his wife, who
had been a maid-of-honour, than from respect
for his name, he had been presented with one of
those old-fashioned Moscow posts that have a
small salary, a queer-sounding name, and absolutely
no duties attached. He never meddled
in anything, and did nothing but smoke from
morning till night, breathing heavily, and always
wrapped in a dressing-gown. His wife was a
sickly irritable woman, for ever worried over
domestic trifles&mdash;over getting her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-66-</a></span>
placed in government schools, and keeping up
her Petersburg connections; she could never
accustom herself to her position and her
remoteness from the Court.</p>

<p>Litvinov’s father had made acquaintance with
the Osinins during his residence at Moscow,
had had occasion to do them some services, and
had once lent them three hundred roubles;
and his son often visited them while he was a
student; his lodging happened to be at no great
distance from their house. But he was not
drawn to them simply as near neighbours, nor
tempted by their comfortless way of living. He
began to be a frequent visitor at their house
after he had fallen in love with their eldest
daughter Irina.</p>

<p>She had then completed her seventeenth year;
she had only just left school, from which her
mother withdrew her through a disagreement
with the principal. This disagreement arose
from the fact that Irina was to have delivered
at a public function some verses in French,
complimentary to the curator, and just before
the performance her place was filled by another
girl, the daughter of a very rich spirit-contractor.
The princess could not stomach this affront;
and indeed Irina herself never forgave the
principal for this act of injustice; she had been
dreaming beforehand of how she would rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-67-</a></span>
before the eyes of every one, attracting universal
attention, and would deliver her speech, and
how Moscow would talk about her afterwards!...
And, indeed, Moscow would have talked
about her afterwards. She was a tall, slim girl,
with a somewhat hollow chest and narrow unformed
shoulders, with a skin of a dead-white,
rare at her age, and pure and smooth as china,
with thick fair hair; there were darker tresses
mingled in a very original way with the light
ones. Her features&mdash;exquisitely, almost too
perfectly, correct&mdash;had not yet quite lost the
innocent expression that belongs to childhood;
the languid curves of her lovely neck, and her
smile&mdash;half-indifferent, half-weary&mdash;betrayed
the nervous temperament of a delicate girl; but
in the lines of those fine, faintly-smiling lips, of
that small, falcon, slightly-narrow nose, there
was something wilful and passionate, something
dangerous for herself and others. Astounding,
really astounding were her eyes, dark grey with
greenish lights, languishing, almond-shaped as
an Egyptian goddess’s, with shining lashes and
bold sweep of eyebrow. There was a strange
look in those eyes; they seemed looking out
intently and thoughtfully&mdash;looking out from
some unknown depth and distance. At school,
Irina had been reputed one of the best pupils
for intelligence and abilities, but of uneven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-68-</a></span>
temper, fond of power, and headstrong; one
class-mistress prophesied that her passions
would be her ruin&mdash;‘<i>vos passions vous perdront</i>’,
on the other hand, another class-mistress censured
her for coldness and want of feeling, and
called her ‘<i>une jeune fille sans cœur</i>.’ Irina’s
companions thought her proud and reserved:
her brothers and sisters stood a little in awe of
her: her mother had no confidence in her: and
her father felt ill at ease when she fastened her
mysterious eyes upon him. But she inspired a
feeling of involuntary respect in both her father
and her mother, not so much through her
qualities, as from a peculiar, vague sense of
expectations which she had, in some undefined
way, awakened in them.</p>

<p>‘You will see, Praskovya Danilovna,’ said the
old prince one day, taking his pipe out of his
mouth, ‘our chit of an Irina will give us all a lift
in the world yet.’</p>

<p>The princess got angry, and told her husband
that he made use of ‘<i>des expressions insupportables</i>’;
afterwards, however, she fell to musing
over his words, and repeated through her teeth:</p>

<p>‘Well ... and it would be a good thing if
we did get a lift.’</p>

<p>Irina enjoyed almost unlimited freedom in
her parents’ house; they did not spoil her,
they even avoided her a little, but they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-69-</a></span>
thwart her, and that was all she wanted....
Sometimes&mdash;during some too humiliating scene&mdash;when
some tradesman would come and
keep shouting, to be heard over the whole
court, that he was sick of coming after his
money, or their own servants would begin
abusing their masters to their face, with ‘fine
princes you are, to be sure; you may whistle
for your supper, and go hungry to bed’&mdash;Irina
would not stir a muscle; she would sit unmoved,
an evil smile on her dark face; and her
smile alone was more bitter to her parents than
any reproaches, and they felt themselves guilty&mdash;guilty,
though guiltless&mdash;towards this being
on whom had been bestowed, as it seemed, from
her very birth, the right to wealth, to luxury,
and to homage.</p>

<p>Litvinov fell in love with Irina from the
moment he saw her (he was only three years
older than she was), but for a long while he
failed to obtain not only a response, but even
a hearing. Her manner to him was even overcast
with a shade of something like hostility;
he did in fact wound her pride, and she concealed
the wound, and could never forgive it.
He was too young and too modest at that
time to understand what might be concealed
under this hostile, almost contemptuous severity.
Often, forgetful of lectures and exercises, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-70-</a></span>
would sit and sit in the Osinins’ cheerless
drawing-room, stealthily watching Irina, his
heart slowly and painfully throbbing and suffocating
him; and she would seem angry or
bored, would get up and walk about the room,
look coldly at him as though he were a table or
chair, shrug her shoulders, and fold her arms.
Or for a whole evening, even when talking with
Litvinov, she would purposely avoid looking at
him, as though denying him even that grace.
Or she would at last take up a book and stare
at it, not reading, but frowning and biting her
lips. Or else she would suddenly ask her father
or brother aloud: ‘What’s the German for
patience?’ He tried to tear himself away from
the enchanted circle in which he suffered and
struggled impotently like a bird in a trap; he
went away from Moscow for a week. He
nearly went out of his mind with misery and
dulness; he returned quite thin and ill to the
Osinins’.... Strange to say, Irina too had
grown perceptibly thinner during those days;
her face had grown pale, her cheeks were wan....
But she met him with still greater coldness,
with almost malignant indifference; as though
he had intensified that secret wound he had
dealt at her pride.... She tortured him in
this way for two months. Then everything was
transformed in one day. It was as though love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-71-</a></span>
had broken into flame with the heat, or had
dropped down from a storm-cloud. One day&mdash;long
will he remember that day&mdash;he was once
more sitting in the Osinins’ drawing-room at
the window, and was looking mechanically into
the street. There was vexation and weariness
in his heart, he despised himself, and yet he
could not move from his place.... He thought
that if a river ran there under the window, he
would throw himself in, with a shudder of fear,
but without a regret. Irina placed herself not
far from him, and was somehow strangely silent
and motionless. For some days now she had
not talked to him at all, or to any one else; she
kept sitting, leaning on her elbows, as though she
were in perplexity, and only rarely she looked
slowly round. This cold torture was at last
more than Litvinov could bear; he got up, and
without saying good-bye, he began to look for
his hat. ‘Stay,’ sounded suddenly, in a soft
whisper. Litvinov’s heart throbbed, he did not
at once recognise Irina’s voice; in that one
word, there was a ring of something that had
never been in it before. He lifted his head and
was stupefied; Irina was looking fondly&mdash;yes,
fondly at him. ‘Stay,’ she repeated; ‘don’t go.
I want to be with you.’ Her voice sank still
lower. ‘Don’t go.... I wish it.’ Understanding
nothing, not fully conscious what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-72-</a></span>
was doing, he drew near her, stretched out his
hands.... She gave him both of hers at
once, then smiling, flushing hotly, she turned
away, and still smiling, went out of the room.
She came back a few minutes later with her
youngest sister, looked at him again with the
same prolonged tender gaze, and made him sit
near her.... At first she could say nothing; she
only sighed and blushed; then she began, timidly
as it were, to question him about his pursuits,
a thing she had never done before. In the
evening of the same day, she tried several times
to beg his forgiveness for not having done him
justice before, assured him she had now become
quite different, astonished him by a sudden outburst
of republicanism (he had at that time a
positive hero-worship for Robespierre, and did
not presume to criticise Marat aloud), and only
a week later he knew that she loved him. Yes;
he long remembered that first day ... but he
did not forget those that came after either&mdash;those
days, when still forcing himself to doubt,
afraid to believe in it, he saw clearly, with
transports of rapture, almost of dread, bliss un-hoped
for coming to life, growing, irresistibly
carrying everything before it, reaching him at
last. Then followed the radiant moments of
first love&mdash;moments which are not destined to
be, and could not fittingly be, repeated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-73-</a></span>
same life. Irina became all at once as docile
as a lamb, as soft as silk, and boundlessly
kind; she began giving lessons to her younger
sisters&mdash;not on the piano, she was no musician,
but in French and English; she read their
school-books with them, and looked after the
housekeeping; everything was amusing and
interesting to her; she would sometimes chatter
incessantly, and sometimes sink into speechless
tenderness; she made all sorts of plans, and
was lost in endless anticipations of what she
would do when she was married to Litvinov
(they never doubted that their marriage would
come to pass), and how together they would ... ‘Work?’
prompted Litvinov.... ‘Yes; work,’
repeated Irina, ‘and read ... but travel before
all things.’ She particularly wanted to leave
Moscow as soon as possible, and when Litvinov
reminded her that he had not yet finished his
course of study at the university, she always
replied, after a moment’s thought, that it was
quite possible to finish his studies at Berlin
or ... somewhere or other. Irina was very
little reserved in the expression of her feelings,
and so her relations with Litvinov did
not long remain a secret from the prince
and princess. Rejoice they could not; but,
taking all circumstances into consideration,
they saw no necessity for putting a veto on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-74-</a></span>
it at once. Litvinov’s fortune was considerable....</p>

<p>‘But his family, his family!’ ... protested
the princess. ‘Yes, his family, of course,’ replied
the prince; but at least he’s not quite a
plebeian; and, what’s the principal point, Irina,
you know, will not listen to us. Has there ever
been a time when she did not do what she
chose? <i>Vous connaissez sa violence!</i> Besides,
there is nothing fixed definitely yet.’ So
reasoned the prince, but mentally he added,
however: ‘Madame Litvinov&mdash;is that all? I
had expected something else.’ Irina took complete
possession of her future <i>fiancé</i>, and indeed
he himself eagerly surrendered himself into her
hands. It was as if he had fallen into a rapid
river, and had lost himself.... And bitter and
sweet it was to him, and he regretted nothing
and heeded nothing. To reflect on the significance
and the duties of marriage, or whether
he, so hopelessly enslaved, could be a good
husband, and what sort of wife Irina would
make, and whether their relations to one
another were what they should be&mdash;was more
than he could bring himself to. His blood was
on fire, he could think of nothing, only&mdash;to
follow her, be with her, for the future without
end, and then&mdash;let come what may!</p>

<p>But in spite of the complete absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-75-</a></span>
opposition on Litvinov’s side, and the wealth of
impulsive tenderness on Irina’s, they did not
get on quite without any misunderstandings
and quarrels. One day he ran to her straight
from the university in an old coat and ink-stained
hands. She rushed to meet him with
her accustomed fond welcome; suddenly she
stopped short.</p>

<p>‘You have no gloves,’ she said abruptly, and
added directly after: ‘Fie! what a student you
are!’</p>

<p>‘You are too particular, Irina,’ remarked
Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘You are a regular student,’ she repeated.
‘<i>Vous n’êtes pas distingué</i>’; and turning her
back on him she went out of the room. It is
true that an hour later she begged him to forgive
her.... As a rule she readily censured
herself and accused herself to him; but, strange
to say, she often almost with tears blamed herself
for evil propensities which she had not, and
obstinately denied her real defects. Another
time he found her in tears, her head in her
hands, and her hair in disorder; and when, all
in agitation, he asked her the cause of her
grief, she pointed with her finger at her own
bosom without speaking. Litvinov gave an
involuntary shiver. ‘Consumption!’ flashed
through his brain, and he seized her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-76-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Are you ill, Irina?’ he articulated in a
shaking voice. (They had already begun on
great occasions to call each other by their first
names.) ‘Let me go at once for a doctor.’</p>

<p>But Irina did not let him finish; she stamped
with her foot in vexation.</p>

<p>‘I am perfectly well ... but this dress ... don’t
you understand?’</p>

<p>‘What is it? ... this dress,’ he repeated in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘What is it? Why, that I have no other,
and that it is old and disgusting, and I am
obliged to put on this dress every day ... even
when you&mdash;Grisha&mdash;Grigory, come here....
You will leave off loving me, at last, seeing
me so slovenly!’</p>

<p>‘For goodness sake, Irina, what are you saying?
That dress is very nice.... It is dear to
me too because I saw you for the first time in
it, darling.’</p>

<p>Irina blushed.</p>

<p>‘Do not remind me, if you please, Grigory
Mihalovitch, that I had no other dress even
then.’</p>

<p>‘But I assure you, Irina Pavlovna, it suits
you so exquisitely.’</p>

<p>‘No, it is horrid, horrid,’ she persisted,
nervously pulling at her long, soft curls. ‘Ugh,
this poverty, poverty and squalor! How is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-77-</a></span>
to escape from this sordidness! How get out
of this squalor!’</p>

<p>Litvinov did not know what to say, and
slightly turned away from her.</p>

<p>All at once Irina jumped up from her chair,
and laid both her hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘But you love me, Grisha? You love me?’
she murmured, putting her face close to him,
and her eyes, still filled with tears, sparkled with
the light of happiness, ‘You love me, dear, even
in this horrid dress?’</p>

<p>Litvinov flung himself on his knees before
her.</p>

<p>‘Ah, love me, love me, my sweet, my saviour,’
she whispered, bending over him.</p>

<p>So the days flew, the weeks passed, and
though as yet there had been no formal declaration,
though Litvinov still deferred his demand
for her hand, not, certainly, at his own desire,
but awaiting directions from Irina (she remarked
sometimes that they were both ridiculously
young, and they must add at least a few weeks
more to their years), still everything was moving
to a conclusion, and the future as it came
nearer grew more and more clearly defined,
when suddenly an event occurred, which scattered
all their dreams and plans like light
roadside dust.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a></h2>


<p>That winter the court visited Moscow. One
festivity followed another; in its turn came
the customary great ball in the Hall of Nobility.
The news of this ball, only, it is true, in the
form of an announcement in the <i>Political
Gazette</i>, reached even the little house in Dogs’
Place. The prince was the first to be roused
by it; he decided at once that he must not fail
to go and take Irina, that it would be unpardonable
to let slip the opportunity of seeing their
sovereigns, that for the old nobility this constituted
indeed a duty in its own way. He defended
his opinion with a peculiar warmth, not
habitual in him; the princess agreed with him
to some extent, and only sighed over the expense;
but a resolute opposition was displayed
by Irina. ‘It is not necessary, I will not go,’
she replied to all her parents’ arguments. Her
obstinacy reached such proportions that the old
prince decided at last to beg Litvinov to try to
persuade her, by reminding her among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-79-</a></span>
reasons that it was not proper for a young girl
to avoid society, that she ought to ‘have this
experience,’ that no one ever saw her anywhere,
as it was. Litvinov undertook to lay these
‘reasons’ before her. Irina looked steadily and
scrutinisingly at him, so steadily and scrutinisingly
that he was confused, and then, playing
with the ends of her sash, she said calmly:</p>

<p>‘Do you desire it, you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.... I suppose so,’ replied Litvinov
hesitatingly. ‘I agree with your papa.... Indeed,
why should you not go ... to see the
world, and show yourself,’ he added with a
short laugh.</p>

<p>‘To show myself,’ she repeated slowly.
‘Very well then, I will go.... Only remember,
it is you yourself who desired it.’</p>

<p>‘That’s to say, I&mdash;&mdash;.’ Litvinov was beginning.</p>

<p>‘You yourself have desired it,’ she interposed.
‘And here is one condition more; you must
promise me that you will not be at this ball.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’</p>

<p>‘I wish it to be so.’</p>

<p>Litvinov unclasped his hands.</p>

<p>‘I submit ... but I confess I should so have
enjoyed seeing you in all your grandeur, witnessing
the sensation you are certain to make....
How proud I should be of you!’ he added
with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-80-</a></span></p>

<p>Irina laughed.</p>

<p>‘All the grandeur will consist of a white
frock, and as for the sensation.... Well, any
way, I wish it.’</p>

<p>‘Irina, darling, you seem to be angry?’</p>

<p>Irina laughed again.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no! I am not angry. Only, Grisha....’ (She
fastened her eyes on him, and he
thought he had never before seen such an expression
in them.) ‘Perhaps, it must be,’ she
added in an undertone.</p>

<p>‘But, Irina, you love me, dear?’</p>

<p>‘I love you,’ she answered with almost solemn
gravity, and she clasped his hand firmly like a
man.</p>

<p>All the following days Irina was busily occupied
over her dress and her coiffure; on the day
before the ball she felt unwell, she could not sit
still, and twice she burst into tears in solitude;
before Litvinov she wore the same uniform
smile.... She treated him, however, with her
old tenderness, but carelessly, and was constantly
looking at herself in the glass. On the
day of the ball she was silent and pale, but collected.
At nine o’clock in the evening Litvinov
came to look at her. When she came to meet
him in a white tarlatan gown, with a spray of
small blue flowers in her slightly raised hair,
he almost uttered a cry; she seemed to him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-81-</a></span>
lovely and stately beyond what was natural to
her years. ‘Yes, she has grown up since this
morning!’ he thought, ‘and how she holds herself!
That’s what race does!’ Irina stood before
him, her hands hanging loose, without smiles or
affectation, and looked resolutely, almost boldly,
not at him, but away into the distance straight
before her.</p>

<p>‘You are just like a princess in a story book,’
said Litvinov at last. ‘You are like a warrior
before the battle, before victory.... You did
not allow me to go to this ball,’ he went on,
while she remained motionless as before, not
because she was not listening to him, but
because she was following another inner voice,
‘but you will not refuse to accept and take with
you these flowers?’</p>

<p>He offered her a bunch of heliotrope. She
looked quickly at Litvinov, stretched out her
hand, and suddenly seizing the end of the spray
which decorated her hair, she said:</p>

<p>‘Do you wish it, Grisha? Only say the
word, and I will tear off all this, and stop at
home.’</p>

<p>Litvinov’s heart seemed fairly bursting. Irina’s
hand had already snatched the spray....</p>

<p>‘No, no, what for?’ he interposed hurriedly,
in a rush of generous and magnanimous feeling,
‘I am not an egoist.... Why should I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-82-</a></span>
restrict your freedom ... when I know that
your heart&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Well, don’t come near me, you will crush
my dress,’ she said hastily.</p>

<p>Litvinov was disturbed.</p>

<p>‘But you will take the nosegay?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Of course; it is very pretty, and I love that
scent. <i>Merci</i>&mdash;I shall keep it in memory&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Of your first coming out,’ observed Litvinov,
‘your first triumph.’</p>

<p>Irina looked over her shoulder at herself in
the glass, scarcely bending her figure.</p>

<p>‘And do I really look so nice? You are not
partial?’</p>

<p>Litvinov overflowed in enthusiastic praises.
Irina was already not listening to him, and
holding the flowers up to her face, she was
again looking away into the distance with her
strange, as it were, overshadowed, dilated eyes,
and the ends of her delicate ribbons stirred by
a faint current of air rose slightly behind her
shoulders like wings.</p>

<p>The prince made his appearance, his hair
well becurled, in a white tie, and a shabby black
evening coat, with the medal of nobility on a
Vladimir ribbon in his buttonhole. After him
came the princess in a china silk dress of
antique cut, and with the anxious severity under
which mothers try to conceal their agitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-83-</a></span>
set her daughter to rights behind, that is
to say, quite needlessly shook out the folds of
her gown. An antiquated hired coach with
seats for four, drawn by two shaggy hacks,
crawled up to the steps, its wheels grating over
the frozen mounds of unswept snow, and a
decrepit groom in a most unlikely-looking
livery came running out of the passage, and
with a sort of desperate courage announced
that the carriage was ready.... After giving
a blessing for the night to the children left at
home, and enfolding themselves in their fur
wraps, the prince and princess went out to the
steps; Irina in a little cloak, too thin and too
short&mdash;how she hated the little cloak at that
moment!&mdash;followed them in silence. Litvinov
escorted them outside, hoping for a last look
from Irina, but she took her seat in the carriage
without turning her head.</p>

<p>About midnight he walked under the windows
of the Hall of Nobility. Countless lights
of huge candelabra shone with brilliant radiance
through the red curtains; and the whole square,
blocked with carriages, was ringing with the
insolent, festive, seductive strains of a waltz of
Strauss’.</p>

<p>The next day at one o’clock, Litvinov betook
himself to the Osinins’. He found no one at
home but the prince, who informed him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-84-</a></span>
once that Irina had a headache, that she was in
bed, and would not get up till the evening, that
such an indisposition was however little to be
wondered at after a first ball.</p>

<p>‘<i>C’est très naturel, vous savez, dans les jeunes
filles</i>,’ he added in French, somewhat to Litvinov’s
surprise; the latter observed at the
same instant that the prince was not in his
dressing-gown as usual, but was wearing a coat.
‘And besides,’ continued Osinin, ‘she may well
be a little upset after the events of yesterday!’</p>

<p>‘Events?’ muttered Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, events, events, <i>de vrais événements</i>.
You cannot imagine, Grigory Mihalovitch, <i>quel
succès elle a eu!</i> The whole court noticed her!
Prince Alexandr Fedorovitch said that her
place was not here, and that she reminded him
of Countess <a id="TN_3">Devonshire</a>. You know ... that ... celebrated....
And old Blazenkrampf
declared in the hearing of all, that Irina was
<i>la reine du bal</i>, and desired to be introduced to
her; he was introduced to me too, that’s to say,
he told me that he remembered me a hussar,
and asked me where I was holding office now.
Most entertaining man that Count, and such an
<i>adorateur du beau sexe!</i> But that’s not all;
my princess ... they gave her no peace
either: Natalya Nikitishna herself conversed
with her ... what more could we have? Irina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-85-</a></span>
danced <i>avec tous les meilleurs cavaliers;</i> they
kept bringing them up to me.... I positively
lost count of them. Would you believe it,
they were all flocking about us in crowds; in
the mazurka they did nothing but seek her out.
One foreign diplomatist, hearing she was a
Moscow girl, said to the Tsar: ‘<i>Sire</i>,’ he said,
‘<i>décidément c’est Moscou qui est le centre de
votre empire!</i>’ and another diplomatist added:
‘<i>C’est une vraie révolution, Sire&mdash;révélation</i> or
<i>révolution</i> ... something of that sort. Yes,
yes, it was. I tell you it was something extraordinary.’</p>

<p>‘Well, and Irina Pavlovna herself?’ inquired
Litvinov, whose hands and feet had grown cold
hearing the prince’s speech, ‘did she enjoy herself,
did she seem pleased?’</p>

<p>‘Of course she enjoyed herself; how could
she fail to be pleased? But, as you know, she’s
not to be seen through at a glance! Every one
was saying to me yesterday: it is really surprising!
<i>jamais on ne dirait que mademoiselle
votre fille est a son premier bal</i>. Count Reisenbach
among the rest ... you know him most
likely.’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t know him at all, and have never
heard of him.’</p>

<p>‘My wife’s cousin.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-86-</a></span></p>

<p>‘A rich man, a chamberlain, living in Petersburg,
in the swim of things; in Livonia every
one is in his hands. Hitherto he has neglected
us ... but there, I don’t bear him ill-will for
that. <i>J’ai l’humeur facile, comme vous savez.</i>
Well, that’s the kind of man he is. He sat
near Irina, conversed with her for a quarter of
an hour, not more, and said afterwards to my
princess: “<i>Ma cousine</i>,” he says, “<i>votre fille est
une perle; c’est une perfection</i>, every one is congratulating
me on such a niece....” And
afterwards I look round&mdash;and he had gone up to
a ... a very great personage, and was talking,
and kept looking at Irina ... and the personage
was looking at her too.’...</p>

<p>‘And so Irina Pavlovna will not appear all
day?’ Litvinov asked again.</p>

<p>‘Quite so; her head aches very badly. She
told me to greet you from her, and thank you
for your flowers, <i>qu’on a trouvé charmant</i>. She
needs rest.... The princess has gone out
on a round of visits ... and I myself ... you
see....’</p>

<p>The prince cleared his throat, and began to
fidget as though he were at a loss what to add
further. Litvinov took his hat, and saying he
did not want to disturb him, and would call
again later to inquire after her health, he went
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-87-</a></span></p>

<p>A few steps from the Osinins’ house he saw
an elegant carriage for two persons standing
before the police sentry-box. A groom in
livery, equally elegant, was bending negligently
from the box, and inquiring of the Finnish
police-sergeant whereabouts Prince Pavel Vassilyevitch
Osinin lived. Litvinov glanced at the
carriage; in it sat a middle-aged man of bloated
complexion, with a wrinkled and haughty face,
a Greek nose, and an evil mouth, muffled in a
sable wrap, by all outward signs a very great
man indeed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-88-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov did not keep his promise of returning
later; he reflected that it would be better
to defer his visit till the following day. When
he went into the too familiar drawing-room
at about twelve o’clock, he found there the two
youngest princesses, Viktorinka and Kleopatrinka.
He greeted them, and then inquired,
‘Was Irina Pavlovna better, and could he see
her?’</p>

<p>‘Irinotchka has gone away with mammy,’
replied Viktorinka; she lisped a little, but was
more forward than her sister.</p>

<p>‘How ... gone away?’ repeated Litvinov,
and there was a sort of still shudder in the very
bottom of his heart. ‘Does she not, does she
not look after you about this time, and give you
your lessons?’</p>

<p>‘Irinotchka will not give us any lessons any
more now,’ answered Viktorinka. ‘Not any
more now,’ Kleopatrinka repeated after her.</p>

<p>‘Is your papa at home?’ asked Litvinov.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-89-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Papa is not at home,’ continued Viktorinka,
‘and Irinotchka is not well; all night long she
was crying and crying....’</p>

<p>‘Crying?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, crying ... Yegorovna told me, and
her eyes are so red, they are quite in-inflamed....’</p>

<p>Litvinov walked twice up and down the room
shuddering as though with cold, and went back
to his lodging. He experienced a sensation
like that which gains possession of a man when
he looks down from a high tower; everything
failed within him, and his head was swimming
slowly with a sense of nausea. Dull stupefaction,
and thoughts scurrying like mice, vague
terror, and the numbness of expectation, and
curiosity&mdash;strange, almost malignant&mdash;and the
weight of crushed tears in his heavy laden
breast, on his lips the forced empty smile, and
a meaningless prayer&mdash;addressed to no one....
Oh, how bitter it all was, and how hideously
degrading! ‘Irina does not want to see me,’
was the thought that was incessantly revolving
in his brain; ‘so much is clear; but why is it?
What can have happened at that ill-fated ball?
And how is such a change possible all at
once? So suddenly....’ People always see
death coming suddenly, but they can never get
accustomed to its suddenness, they feel it senseless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-90-</a></span>
‘She sends no message for me, does not
want to explain herself to me....’</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ called a strained voice
positively in his ear.</p>

<p>Litvinov started, and saw before him his
servant with a note in his hand. He recognised
Irina’s writing.... Before he had broken the
seal, he had a foreknowledge of woe, and bent
his head on his breast and hunched his shoulders,
as though shrinking from the blow.</p>

<p>He plucked up courage at last, and tore open
the envelope all at once. On a small sheet of
notepaper were the following lines:</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Grigory Mihalitch. All is
over between us; I am going away to Petersburg.
I am dreadfully unhappy, but the thing
is done. It seems my fate ... but no, I do
not want to justify myself. My presentiments
have been realised. Forgive me, forget me;
I am not worthy of you.&mdash;Irina. Be magnanimous:
do not try to see me.’</p>

<p>Litvinov read these five lines, and slowly
dropped on to the sofa, as though some one had
dealt him a blow on the breast. He dropped
the note, picked it up, read it again, whispered
‘to Petersburg,’ and dropped it again; that was
all. There even came upon him a sense of
peace; he even, with his hands thrown behind
him, smoothed the pillow under his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-91-</a></span>
‘Men wounded to death don’t fling themselves
about,’ he thought, ‘as it has come, so it has
gone. All this is natural enough: I always
expected it....’ (He was lying to himself;
he had never expected anything like it.)
‘Crying?... Was she crying?... What was
she crying for? Why, she did not love me!
But all that is easily understood and in accordance
with her character. She&mdash;she is not
worthy of me.... That’s it!’ (He laughed
bitterly.) ‘She did not know herself what
power was latent in her,&mdash;well, convinced of it
in her effect at the ball, was it likely she would
stay with an insignificant student?&mdash;all that’s
easily understood.’</p>

<p>But then he remembered her tender words,
her smile, and those eyes, those never to be forgotten
eyes, which he would never see again,
which used to shine and melt at simply meeting
his eyes; he recalled one swift, timorous, burning
kiss&mdash;and suddenly he fell to sobbing,
sobbing convulsively, furiously, vindictively;
turned over on his face, and choking and
stifling with frenzied satisfaction as though
thirsting to tear himself to pieces with all around
him, he turned his hot face in the sofa pillow,
and bit it in his teeth.</p>

<p>Alas! the gentleman whom Litvinov had
seen the day before in the carriage was no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-92-</a></span>
than the cousin of the Princess Osinin, the rich
chamberlain, Count Reisenbach. Noticing the
sensation produced by Irina on certain personages
of the highest rank, and instantaneously
reflecting what advantages might <i>mit etwas
Accuratesse</i> be derived from the fact, the count
made his plan at once like a man of energy and
a skilful courtier. He decided to act swiftly, in
Napoleonic style. ‘I will take that original
girl into my house,’ was what he meditated, ‘in
Petersburg; I will make her my heiress, devil
take me, of my whole property even; as I have
no children. She is my niece, and my countess
is dull all alone.... It’s always more agreeable
to have a pretty face in one’s drawing-room....
Yes, yes; ... that’s it; <i>es ist eine Idee, es
ist eine Idee!</i>’ He would have to dazzle,
bewilder, and impress the parents. ‘They’ve
not enough to eat’&mdash;the count pursued his
reflection when he was in the carriage and on
his way to Dogs’ Place&mdash;‘so, I warrant, they
won’t be obstinate. They’re not such over-sentimental
folks either. I might give them a
sum of money down into the bargain. And
she? She will consent. Honey is sweet&mdash;she
had a taste of it last night. It’s a whim on my
part, granted; let them profit by it, ... the
fools. I shall say to them one thing and
another ... and you must decide&mdash;otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-93-</a></span>
I shall adopt another&mdash;an orphan&mdash;which
would be still more suitable. Yes or no&mdash;twenty-four
hours I fix for the term&mdash;<i>und
damit Punctum</i>.’</p>

<p>And with these very words on his lips, the
count presented himself before the prince,
whom he had forewarned of his visit the evening
before at the ball. On the result of this visit it
seems hardly worth while to enlarge further.
The count was not mistaken in his prognostications:
the prince and princess were in fact
not obstinate, and accepted the sum of money;
and Irina did in fact consent before the allotted
term had expired. It was not easy for her to
break off her relations with Litvinov; she loved
him; and after sending him her note, she
almost kept her bed, weeping continually, and
grew thin and wan. But for all that, a month
later the princess carried her off to Petersburg,
and established her at the count’s; committing
her to the care of the countess, a very kind-hearted
woman, but with the brain of a hen,
and something of a hen’s exterior.</p>

<p>Litvinov threw up the university, and went
home to his father in the country. Little by
little his wound healed. At first he had no
news of Irina, and indeed he avoided all conversation
that touched on Petersburg and
Petersburg society. Later on, by degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-94-</a></span>
rumours&mdash;not evil exactly, but curious&mdash;began
to circulate about her; gossip began to be busy
about her. The name of the young Princess
Osinin, encircled in splendour, impressed with
quite a special stamp, began to be more and
more frequently mentioned even in provincial
circles. It was pronounced with curiosity,
respect, and envy, as men at one time used to
mention the name of the Countess Vorotinsky.
At last the news came of her marriage. But
Litvinov hardly paid attention to these last
tidings; he was already betrothed to Tatyana.</p>

<p>Now, the reader can no doubt easily understand
exactly what it was Litvinov recalled
when he cried, ‘Can it be she?’ and therefore
we will return to Baden and take up again the
broken thread of our story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-95-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="X" id="X">X</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov fell asleep very late, and did not
sleep long; the sun had only just risen when he
got out of bed. The summits of dark mountains
visible from his windows stood out in
misty purple against the clear sky. ‘How cool
it must be there under the trees!’ he thought;
and he dressed in haste, and looked with indifference
at the bouquet which had opened
more luxuriantly after the night; he took a
stick and set off towards the ‘Old Castle’ on
the famous ‘Cliffs.’ Invigorating and soothing
was the caressing contact of the fresh morning
about him. He drew long breaths, and stepped
out boldly; the vigorous health of youth was
throbbing in every vein; the very earth seemed
springy under his light feet. With every step
he grew more light-hearted, more happy; he
walked in the dewy shade in the thick sand of
the little paths, beside the fir-trees that were
fringed with the vivid green of the spring shoots
at the end of every twig. ‘How jolly it is!’ he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-96-</a></span>
kept repeating to himself. Suddenly he heard
the sound of familiar voices; he looked ahead
and saw Voroshilov and Bambaev coming to
meet him. The sight of them jarred upon him;
he rushed away like a school-boy avoiding his
teacher, and hid himself behind a
bush.... ‘My Creator!’ he prayed, ‘mercifully remove
my countrymen!’ He felt that he would not
have grudged any money at the moment if only
they did not see him.... And they actually
did not see him: the Creator was merciful to
him. Voroshilov, in his self-confident military
voice, was holding forth to Bambaev on the
various phases of Gothic architecture, and
Bambaev only grunted approvingly; it was
obvious that Voroshilov had been dinning his
phrases into him a long while, and the good-natured
enthusiast was beginning to be bored.
Compressing his lips and craning his neck,
Litvinov listened a long while to their retreating
footsteps; for a long time the accents of instructive
discourse&mdash;now guttural, now nasal&mdash;reached
his ears; at last, all was still again.
Litvinov breathed freely, came out of his ambush,
and walked on.</p>

<p>For three hours he wandered about the
mountains. Sometimes he left the path, and
jumped from rock to rock, slipping now and
then on the smooth moss; then he would sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-97-</a></span>
down on a fragment of the cliff under an oak
or a beech, and muse on pleasant fancies to
the never-ceasing gurgle of the little rills over-grown
with ferns, the soothing rustle of the
leaves, and the shrill notes of a solitary blackbird.
A light and equally pleasant drowsiness
began to steal over him, it seemed to approach
him caressingly, and he dropped asleep ... but
suddenly he smiled and looked round; the
gold and green of the forest, and the moving
foliage beat down softly on his eyes&mdash;and again
he smiled and again closed them. He began
to want breakfast, and he made his way towards
the old castle where for a few kreutzers he
could get a glass of good milk and coffee. But
he had hardly had time to establish himself at
one of the little white-painted tables set on the
platform before the castle, when the heavy
tramping of horses was heard, and three open
carriages drove up, out of which stepped a rather
numerous company of ladies and gentlemen....
Litvinov at once recognised them as Russians,
though they were all talking French ... just
because they were all talking French. The
ladies’ dresses were marked by a studied
elegance; the gentlemen wore close-fitting coats
with waists&mdash;which is not altogether usual nowadays&mdash;grey
trousers of fancy material, and very
glossy town hats. A narrow black cravat closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-98-</a></span>
fettered the neck of each of these gentlemen,
and something military was apparent in their
whole deportment. They were, in fact, military
men; Litvinov had chanced upon a picnic
party of young generals&mdash;persons of the highest
society, of weight and importance. Their importance
was clearly expressed in everything:
in their discreet nonchalance, in their amiably
condescending smiles, in the intense indifference
of their expression, the effeminate little movements
of their shoulders, the swing of the
figure, and the crook of the knees; it was
expressed, too, in the sound of their voices, which
seemed to be affably and fastidiously thanking
a subservient multitude. All these officers
were superlatively washed and shaved, and
thoroughly saturated with that genuine aroma
of nobility and the Guards, compounded of
the best cigar smoke, and the most marvellous
patchouli. They all had the hands too of
noblemen&mdash;white and large, with nails firm as
ivory; their moustaches seemed positively
polished, their teeth shone, and their skin&mdash;rosy
on their cheeks, bluish on their chins&mdash;was most
delicate and fine. Some of the young generals
were frivolous, others were serious; but the
stamp of the best breeding was on all of them.
Each of them seemed to be deeply conscious
of his own dignity, and the importance of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-99-</a></span>
own future part in the government, and conducted
himself with severity and ease, with a
faint shade of that carelessness, that ‘deuce-take-it’
air, which comes out so naturally during
foreign travel. The party seated themselves
with much noise and ostentation, and called
the obsequious waiters. Litvinov made haste
to drink off his glass of milk, paid for it, and
putting his hat on, was just making off past the
party of generals....</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ he heard a woman’s
voice. ‘Don’t you recognise me?’</p>

<p>He stopped involuntarily. That voice ...
that voice had too often set his heart beating in
the past.... He turned round and saw Irina.</p>

<p>She was sitting at a table, her arms folded on
the back of a chair drawn up near; with her
head bent on one side and a smile on her face,
she was looking at him cordially, almost with
delight.</p>

<p>Litvinov knew her at once, though she had
changed since he saw her that last time ten
years ago, though she had been transformed
from a girl into a woman. Her slim figure had
developed and reached its perfection, the lines
of her once narrow shoulders now recalled the
goddesses that stand out on the ceilings of
ancient Italian palaces. But her eyes remained
the same, and it seemed to Litvinov that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-100-</a></span>
were looking at him just as in those days in the
little house in Moscow.</p>

<p>‘Irina Pavlovna,’ he uttered irresolutely.</p>

<p>‘You know me? How glad I am! how
glad&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>She stopped short, slightly blushing, and
drew herself up.</p>

<p>‘This is a very pleasant meeting,’ she continued
now in French. ‘Let me introduce you
to my husband. <i>Valérien, Monsieur Litvinov,
un ami d’enfance;</i> Valerian Vladimirovitch
Ratmirov, my husband.’</p>

<p>One of the young generals, almost the most
elegant of all, got up from his seat, and with
excessive courtesy bowed to Litvinov, while the
rest of his companions faintly knitted their
brows, or rather each of them withdrew for an
instant into himself, as though protesting betimes
against any contact with an extraneous
civilian, and the other ladies taking part in the
picnic thought fit to screw up their eyes a little
and simper, and even to assume an air of perplexity.</p>

<p>‘Have you&mdash;er&mdash;been long in Baden?’ asked
General Ratmirov, with a dandified air utterly
un-Russian. He obviously did not know what
to talk about with the friend of his wife’s childhood.</p>

<p>‘No, not long!’ replied Litvinov.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-101-</a></span></p>

<p>‘And do you intend to stay long?’ pursued
the polite general.</p>

<p>‘I have not made up my mind yet.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! that is very delightful ... very.’</p>

<p>The general paused. Litvinov, too, was
speechless. Both held their hats in their
hands and bending forward with a grin, gazed
at the top of each other’s heads.</p>

<p>‘<i>Deux gendarmes un beau dimanche</i>,’ began
humming&mdash;out of tune of course, we have never
come across a Russian nobleman who did not
sing out of tune&mdash;a dull-eyed and yellow-faced
general, with an expression of constant irritability
on his face, as though he could not forgive
himself for his own appearance. Among all his
companions he alone had not the complexion
of a rose.</p>

<p>‘But why don’t you sit down, Grigory Mihalitch,’
observed Irina at last.</p>

<p>Litvinov obeyed and sat down.</p>

<p>‘<i>I say, Valérien, give me some fire</i>,’ remarked
in English another general, also young, but
already stout, with fixed eyes which seemed
staring into the air, and thick silky whiskers,
into which he slowly plunged his snow-white
fingers. Ratmirov gave him a silver matchbox.</p>

<p>‘<i>Avez vous des papiros?</i>’ asked one of the
ladies, with a lisp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-102-</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>De vrais papelitos, comtesse.</i>’</p>

<p>‘<i>Deux gendarmes un beau dimanche</i>,’ the dull-eyed
general hummed again, with intense exasperation.</p>

<p>‘You must be sure to come and see us,’ Irina
was saying to Litvinov meantime; ‘we are
staying at the Hôtel de l’Europe. From four to
six I am always at home. We have not seen
each other for such a long time.’</p>

<p>Litvinov looked at Irina; she did not drop
her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Irina Pavlovna, it is a long time&mdash;ever
since we were at Moscow.’</p>

<p>‘At Moscow, yes, at Moscow,’ she repeated
abruptly. ‘Come and see me, we will talk and
recall old times. Do you know, Grigory Mihalitch,
you have not changed much.’</p>

<p>‘Really? But you have changed, Irina Pavlovna.’</p>

<p>‘I have grown older.’</p>

<p>‘No, I did not mean that.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Irène?</i>’ said a lady in a yellow hat and with
yellow hair in an interrogative voice after some
preliminary whispering and giggling with the
officer sitting near her. ‘<i>Irène?</i>’</p>

<p>‘I am older,’ pursued Irina, without answering
the lady, ‘but I am not changed. No, no,
I am changed in nothing.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Deux gendarmes un beau dimanche!</i>’ was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-103-</a></span>
heard again. The irritable general only remembered
the first line of the well-known
ditty.</p>

<p>‘It still pricks a little, your excellency,’
observed the stout general with the whiskers,
with a loud and broad intonation, apparently
quoting from some amusing story, well-known
to the whole <i>beau monde</i>, and, with a short
wooden laugh he again fell to staring into the
air. All the rest of the party laughed too.</p>

<p>‘What a sad dog you are, Boris!’ observed
Ratmirov in an undertone. He spoke in English
and pronounced even the name ‘Boris’ as
if it were English.</p>

<p>‘<i>Irène?</i>’ the lady in the yellow hat said
inquiringly for the third time. Irina turned
sharply round to her.</p>

<p>‘<i>Eh bien? quoi? que me voulez-vous?</i>’</p>

<p>‘<i>Je vous dirai plus tard</i>,’ replied the lady,
mincing. With a very unattractive exterior,
she was for ever mincing and grimacing. Some
wit said of her that she ‘<i>minaudait dans le vide</i>,’
‘grimaced upon the desert air.’</p>

<p>Irina frowned and shrugged her shoulders
impatiently. ‘<i>Mais que fait donc Monsieur
Verdier? Pourquoi ne vient-il pas?</i>’ cried one
lady with that prolonged drawl which is the
peculiarity of the Great Russian accent, and
is so insupportable to French ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-104-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ah, voo, ah, voo, mossoo Verdew, mossoo
Verdew,’ sighed another lady, whose birthplace
was Arzamass.</p>

<p>‘<i>Tranquillisez-vous, mesdames</i>,’ interposed
Ratmirov. ‘<i>Monsieur Verdier m’a promis de
venir se mettre à vos pieds.</i>’</p>

<p>‘He, he, he!’&mdash;The ladies fluttered their
fans.</p>

<p>The waiter brought some glasses of beer.</p>

<p>‘<i>Baierisch-Bier?</i>’ inquired the general with
whiskers, assuming a bass voice, and affecting
astonishment&mdash;‘<i>Guten Morgen.</i>’</p>

<p>‘Well? Is Count Pavel still there?’ one
young general inquired coldly and listlessly of
another.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied the other equally coldly, ‘<i>Mais
c’est provisoire</i>. <i>Serge</i>, they say, will be put in
his place.’</p>

<p>‘Aha!’ filtered the first through his teeth.</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes,’ filtered the second.</p>

<p>‘I can’t understand,’ began the general who
had hummed the song, ‘I can’t understand
what induced Paul to defend himself&mdash;to
bring forward all sorts of reasons. Certainly,
he crushed the merchant pretty well, <i>il lui a
fait rendre gorge</i> ... well, and what of it? He
may have had his own motives.’</p>

<p>‘He was afraid ... of being shown up in the
newspapers,’ muttered some one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-105-</a></span></p>

<p>The irritable general grew hot.</p>

<p>‘Well, it is too much! Newspapers! Shown
up! If it depended on me, I would not let
anything be printed in those papers but the
taxes on meat or bread, and announcements of
sales of boots or furs.’</p>

<p>‘And gentlemen’s properties up for auction,’
put in Ratmirov.</p>

<p>‘Possibly under present circumstances....
What a conversation, though, in Baden <i>au Vieux-Château</i>.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Mais pas du tout! pas du tout!</i>’ replied the
lady in the yellow hat, ‘<i>j’adore les questions
politiques</i>.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Madame a raison</i>,’ interposed another general
with an exceedingly pleasant and girlish-looking
face. ‘Why should we avoid those
questions ... even in Baden?’</p>

<p>As he said these words he looked urbanely
at Litvinov and smiled condescendingly. ‘A
man of honour ought never under any circumstances
to disown his convictions. Don’t you
think so?’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ rejoined the irritable general,
darting a look at Litvinov, and as it were indirectly
attacking him, ‘but I don’t see the
necessity....’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ the condescending general interposed
with the same mildness, ‘your friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-106-</a></span>
Valerian Vladimirovitch, just referred to the sale
of gentlemen’s estates. Well? Is not that a fact?’</p>

<p>‘But it’s impossible to sell them nowadays;
nobody wants them!’ cried the irritable general.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps ... perhaps. For that very reason
we ought to proclaim that fact ... that sad
fact at every step. We are ruined ... very
good; we are beggared ... there’s no disputing
about that; but we, the great owners, we
still represent a principle ... <i>un principe</i>. To
preserve that principle is our duty. <i>Pardon,
madame</i>, I think you dropped your handkerchief.
When some, so to say, darkness has
come over even the highest minds, we ought
submissively to point out (the general held out
his finger) with the finger of a citizen the abyss
to which everything is tending. We ought to
warn, we ought to say with respectful firmness,
‘turn back, turn back.... That is what we
ought to say.’</p>

<p>‘There’s no turning back altogether, though,’
observed Ratmirov moodily.</p>

<p>The condescending general only grinned.</p>

<p>‘Yes, altogether, altogether, <i>mon très cher</i>.
The further back the better.’</p>

<p>The general again looked courteously at
Litvinov. The latter could not stand it.</p>

<p>‘Are we to return as far as the Seven Boyars,
your excellency?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-107-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why not? I express my opinion without
hesitation; we must undo ... yes ... undo
all that has been done.’</p>

<p>‘And the emancipation of the serfs.’</p>

<p>‘And the emancipation ... as far as that
is possible. <i>On est patriote ou on ne l’est pas.</i>
“And freedom?” they say to me. Do you
suppose that freedom is prized by the people?
Ask them&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Just try,’ broke in Litvinov, ‘taking that
freedom away again.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Comment nommez-vous ce monsieur?</i>’ whispered
the general to Ratmirov.</p>

<p>‘What are you discussing here?’ began the
stout general suddenly. He obviously played
the part of the spoilt child of the party. ‘Is it all
about the newspapers? About penny-a-liners?
Let me tell you a little anecdote of what happened
to me with a scribbling fellow&mdash;such a
lovely thing. I was told he had written a libel on
me. Well, of course, I at once had him brought
before me. They brought me the penny-a-liner.</p>

<p>‘“How was it,” said I, “my dear chap, you
came to write this libel? Was your patriotism
too much for you?” “Yes, it was too much,” says
he. “Well,” says I, “and do you like money?”
“Yes,” says he. Then, gentlemen, I gave him
the knob of my cane to sniff at. “And do you
like that, my angel?” “No,” says he, “I don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-108-</a></span>’t
like that.” “But sniff it as you ought,” says I,
“my hands are clean.” “I don’t like it,” says he,
“and that’s all.” “But I like it very much, my
angel,” says I, “though not for myself. Do you
understand that allegory, my treasure?” “Yes,”
says he. “Then mind and be a good boy for the
future, and now here’s a rouble sterling for you;
go away and be grateful to me night and day,”
and so the scribbling chap went off.’</p>

<p>The general burst out laughing and again
every one followed his example&mdash;every one
except Irina, who did not even smile and looked
darkly at the speaker.</p>

<p>The condescending general slapped Boris on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>‘That’s all your invention, O friend of my
bosom.... You threatening any one with a
stick.... You haven’t got a stick. <i>C’est pour
faire rire ces dames.</i> For the sake of a good
story. But that’s not the point. I said
just now that we must turn back completely.
Understand me. I am not hostile to so-called
progress, but all these universities and seminaries,
and popular schools, these students,
priests’ sons, and commoners, all these small
fry, <i>tout ce fond du sac, la petite propriété,
pire que le prolétariat</i> (the general uttered this
in a languishing, almost faint voice) <i>voilà ce qui
m’effraie</i> ... that’s where one ought to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-109-</a></span>
the line, and make other people draw it too.’
(Again he gave Litvinov a genial glance.) ‘Yes,
one must draw the line. Don’t forget that
among us no one makes any demand, no one is
asking for anything. Local government, for
instance&mdash;who asks for that? Do you ask for
it? or you, or you? or you, <i>mesdames?</i> You
rule not only yourselves but all of us, you know.’
(The general’s handsome face was lighted up by
a smile of amusement.) ‘My dear friends, why
should we curry favour with the multitude.
You like democracy, it flatters you, and serves
your ends ... but you know it’s a double
weapon. It is better in the old way, as before
... far more secure. Don’t deign to reason
with the herd, trust in the aristocracy, in that
alone is power.... Indeed it will be better.
And progress ... I certainly have nothing
against progress. Only don’t give us lawyers
and sworn juries and elective officials ... only
don’t touch discipline, discipline before all things&mdash;you
may build bridges, and quays, and hospitals,
and why not light the streets with gas?’</p>

<p>‘Petersburg has been set on fire from one
end to the other, so there you have your progress!’
hissed the irritable general.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you’re a mischievous fellow, I can see,’
said the stout general, shaking his head lazily;
‘you would do for a chief-prosecutor, but in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-110-</a></span>
opinion <i>avec Orphée aux enfers le progrès a dit
son dernier mot</i>.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Vous dites toujours des bêtises</i>,’ giggled the
lady from Arzamass.</p>

<p>The general looked dignified.</p>

<p>‘<i>Je ne suis jamais plus sérieux, madame, que
quand je dis des bêtises.</i>’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Verdier has uttered that very
phrase several times already,’ observed Irina in
a low voice.</p>

<p>‘<i>De la poigne et des formes</i>,’ cried the stout
general, ‘<i>de la poigne surtout</i>. And to translate
into Russian: be civil but don’t spare
your fists.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you’re a rascal, an incorrigible rascal,’
interposed the condescending general. ‘<i>Mesdames</i>,
don’t listen to him, please. A barking
dog does not bite. He cares for nothing but
flirtation.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not right, though, Boris,’ began
Ratmirov, after exchanging a glance with his
wife, ‘it’s all very well to be mischievous, but
that’s going too far. Progress is a phenomenon
of social life, and this is what we must not
forget; it’s a symptom. It’s what we must
watch.’</p>

<p>‘All right, I say,’ observed the stout general,
wrinkling up his nose; ‘we all know you are
aiming at the ministry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-111-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Not at all ... the ministry indeed! But
really one can’t refuse to recognise things.’</p>

<p>Boris plunged his fingers again into his
whiskers, and stared into the air.</p>

<p>‘Social life is very important, because in the
development of the people, in the destinies, so
to speak, of the country&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘<i>Valérien</i>,’ interrupted Boris reprovingly,
‘<i>il y a des dames ici</i>. I did not expect this of
you, or do you want to get on to a committee?’</p>

<p>‘But they are all closed now, thank God,’ put
in the irritable general, and he began humming
again ‘<i>Deux gendarmes un beau dimanche</i>.’</p>

<p>Ratmirov raised a cambric handkerchief to his
nose and gracefully retired from the discussion;
the condescending general repeated ‘Rascal!
rascal!’ but Boris turned to the lady who
‘grimaced upon the desert air’ and without
lowering his voice, or a change in the expression
of his face, began to ply her with questions as to
when ‘she would reward his devotion,’ as though
he were desperately in love with her and suffering
tortures on her account.</p>

<p>At every moment during this conversation Litvinov
felt more and more ill at ease. His pride,
his clean plebeian pride, was fairly in revolt.</p>

<p>What had he, the son of a petty official,
in common with these military aristocrats of
Petersburg? He loved everything they hated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-112-</a></span>
he hated everything they loved; he was only
too vividly conscious of it, he felt it in every
part of his being. Their jokes he thought dull,
their tone intolerable, every gesture false; in the
very smoothness of their speeches he detected
a note of revolting contemptuousness&mdash;and yet
he was, as it were, abashed before them, before
these creatures, these enemies. ‘Ugh! how
disgusting! I am in their way, I am ridiculous
to them,’ was the thought that kept revolving
in his head. ‘Why am I stopping? Let me
escape at once, at once.’ Irina’s presence could
not retain him; she, too, aroused melancholy
emotions in him. He got up from his seat and
began to take leave.</p>

<p>‘You are going already?’ said Irina, but
after a moment’s reflection she did not press
him to stay, and only extracted a promise from
him that he would not fail to come and see her.
General Ratmirov took leave of him with the
same refined courtesy, shook hands with him
and accompanied him to the end of the platform....
But Litvinov had scarcely had time
to turn round the first bend in the road when
he heard a general roar of laughter behind him.
This laughter had no reference to him, but was
occasioned by the long-expected Monsieur
Verdier, who suddenly made his appearance on
the platform, in a Tyrolese hat, and blue blouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-113-</a></span>
riding a donkey, but the blood fairly rushed
into Litvinov’s cheeks, and he felt intense
bitterness: his tightly compressed lips seemed
as though drawn by wormwood. ‘Despicable,
vulgar creatures,’ he muttered, without reflecting
that the few minutes he had spent in their
company had not given him sufficient ground
for such severe criticism. And this was the
world into which Irina had fallen, Irina, once
his Irina! In this world she moved, and lived,
and reigned; for it, she had sacrificed her personal
dignity, the noblest feelings of her heart....
It was clearly as it should be; it was clear
that she had deserved no better fate! How
glad he was that she had not thought of
questioning him about his intentions! He
might have opened his heart before ‘them’ in
‘their’ presence.... ‘For nothing in the
world! never!’ murmured Litvinov, inhaling
deep draughts of the fresh air and descending
the road towards Baden almost at a run. He
thought of his betrothed, his sweet, good,
sacred Tatyana, and how pure, how noble, how
true she seemed to him. With what unmixed
tenderness he recalled her features, her words,
her very gestures ... with what impatience
he looked forward to her return.</p>

<p>The rapid exercise soothed his nerves.
Returning home he sat down at the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">-114-</a></span>
took up a book; suddenly he let it fall, even
with a shudder.... What had happened to
him? Nothing had happened, but Irina ...
Irina.... All at once his meeting with her
seemed something marvellous, strange, extraordinary.
Was it possible? he had met, he
had talked with the same Irina.... And why
was there no trace in her of that hateful worldliness
which was so sharply stamped upon all
these others. Why did he fancy that she
seemed, as it were, weary, or sad, or sick of her
position? She was in their camp, but she was
not an enemy. And what could have impelled
her to receive him joyfully, to invite him to see
her?</p>

<p>Litvinov started. ‘O Tanya, Tanya!’ he
cried passionately, ‘you are my guardian
angel, you only, my good genius. I love you
only and will love you for ever. And I will
not go to see <i>her</i>. Forget her altogether! Let
her amuse herself with her generals.’ Litvinov
set to his book again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-115-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov took up his book again, but he
could not read. He went out of the house,
walked a little, listened to the music, glanced
in at the gambling, returned again to his room,
and tried again to read&mdash;still without success.
The time seemed to drag by with peculiar
dreariness. Pishtchalkin, the well-intentioned
peaceable mediator, came in and sat with him
for three hours. He talked, argued, stated
questions, and discoursed intermittently, first
of elevated, and then of practical topics, and
succeeded in diffusing around him such an
atmosphere of dulness that poor Litvinov was
ready to cry. In raising dulness&mdash;agonising,
chilling, helpless, hopeless dulness&mdash;to a fine
art, Pishtchalkin was absolutely unrivalled even
among persons of the highest morality, who
are notoriously masters in that line. The mere
sight of his well-cut and well-brushed head, his
clear lifeless eyes, his benevolent nose, produced
an involuntary despondency, and his deliberate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-116-</a></span>
drowsy, lazy tone seemed to have been created
only to state with conviction and lucidity such
sententious truths as that twice two makes four
and not five or three, that water is liquid, and
benevolence laudable; that to the private individual,
no less than to the state, and to the
state no less than to the private individual,
credit is absolutely indispensable for financial
operations. And with all this he was such an
excellent man! But such is the sentence the
fates have passed on Russia; among us, good
men are dull. Pishtchalkin retreated at last;
he was replaced by Bindasov, who, without
any beating about the bush, asked Litvinov
with great effrontery for a loan of a hundred
guldens, and the latter gave it him, in spite of
the fact that Bindasov was not only unattractive,
but even repulsive to him, that he knew for
certain that he would never get his money
back; and was, besides, himself in need of it.
What made him give him the money then, the
reader will inquire. Who can tell! That is
another Russian weakness. Let the reader lay
his hand on his heart and remember how many
acts in his own life have had absolutely no
other reason. And Bindasov did not even
thank Litvinov; he asked for a glass of red
Baden wine, and without wiping his lips departed,
loudly and offensively tramping with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-117-</a></span>
boots. And how vexed Litvinov was with himself
already, as he watched the red nape of the
retreating sharper’s neck! Before evening he
received a letter from Tatyana in which she
informed him that as her aunt was not well,
she could not come to Baden for five or six
days. This news had a depressing influence
on Litvinov; it increased his vexation, and he
went to bed early in a disagreeable frame of
mind. The following day turned out no better,
if not worse, than the preceding. From early
morning Litvinov’s room was filled with his
own countrymen; Bambaev, Voroshilov, Pishtchalkin,
the two officers, the two Heidelberg
students, all crowded in at once, and yet did
not go away right up till dinner time, though
they had soon said all they had to say and
were obviously bored. They simply did not
know what to do with themselves, and having
got into Litvinov’s lodgings they ‘stuck’ there,
as they say. First they discussed the fact that
Gubaryov had gone back to Heidelberg, and that
they would have to go after him; then they
philosophised a little, and touched on the
Polish question; then they advanced to reflections
on gambling and <i>cocottes</i>, and fell to
repeating scandalous anecdotes; at last the
conversation sank into a discussion of all sorts
of ‘strong men’ and monsters of obesity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-118-</a></span>
gluttony. First, they trotted out all the ancient
stories of Lukin, of the deacon who ate no less
than thirty-three herrings for a wager, of the
Uhlan colonel, Ezyedinov, renowned for his
corpulence, and of the soldier who broke the
shin-bone on his own forehead; then followed
unadulterated lying. Pishtchalkin himself related
with a yawn that he knew a peasant
woman in Little Russia, who at the time of
her death had proved to weigh half a ton and
some pounds, and a landowner who had eaten
three geese and a sturgeon for luncheon; Bambaev
suddenly fell into an ecstatic condition,
and declared he himself was able to eat a
whole sheep, ‘with seasoning’ of course; and
Voroshilov burst out with something about a
comrade, an athletic cadet, so grotesque that
every one was reduced to silence, and after looking
at each other, they took up their hats, and the
party broke up. Litvinov, when he was left
alone, tried to occupy himself, but he felt just as
if his head was full of smouldering soot; he could
do nothing that was of any use, and the evening
too was wasted. The next morning he was just
preparing for lunch, when some one knocked at
his door. ‘Good Lord,’ thought Litvinov, ‘one
of yesterday’s dear friends again,’ and not without
some trepidation he pronounced:</p>

<p>‘<i>Herein!</i>’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-119-</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened slowly and in walked
Potugin. Litvinov was exceedingly delighted
to see him.</p>

<p>‘This is nice!’ he began, warmly shaking
hands with his unexpected visitor, ‘this is good
of you! I should certainly have looked you
up myself, but you would not tell me where
you live. Sit down, please, put down your
hat. Sit down.’</p>

<p>Potugin made no response to Litvinov’s
warm welcome, and remained standing in the
middle of the room, shifting from one leg to
the other; he only laughed a little and shook
his head. Litvinov’s cordial reception obviously
touched him, but there was some constraint in
the expression of his face.</p>

<p>‘There’s ... some little misunderstanding,’
he began, not without hesitation. ‘Of course,
it would always be ... a pleasure ... to me ...
but I have been sent ... especially to
you.’</p>

<p>‘That’s to say, do you mean,’ commented
Litvinov in an injured voice, ‘that you would
not have come to me of your own accord?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, ... indeed! But I ... I should,
perhaps, not have made up my mind to intrude
on you to-day, if I had not been asked to come
to you. In fact, I have a message for you.’</p>

<p>‘From whom, may I ask?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-120-</a></span></p>

<p>‘From a person you know, from Irina
Pavlovna Ratmirov. You promised three days
ago to go and see her and you have not been.’</p>

<p>Litvinov stared at Potugin in amazement.</p>

<p>‘You know Madame Ratmirov?’</p>

<p>‘As you see.’</p>

<p>‘And you know her well?’</p>

<p>‘I am to a certain degree a friend of hers.’</p>

<p>Litvinov was silent for a little.</p>

<p>‘Allow me to ask you,’ he began at last, ‘do
you know why Irina Pavlovna wants to see
me?’</p>

<p>Potugin went up to the window.</p>

<p>‘To a certain degree I do. She was, as far
as I can judge, very pleased at meeting you,&mdash;well,&mdash;and
she wants to renew your former
relations.’</p>

<p>‘Renew,’ repeated Litvinov. ‘Excuse my
indiscretion, but allow me to question you a
little more. Do you know what was the
nature of those relations?’</p>

<p>‘Strictly speaking ... no, I don’t know. But
I imagine,’ added Potugin, turning suddenly
to Litvinov and looking affectionately at him,
‘I imagine that they were of some value. Irina
Pavlovna spoke very highly of you, and I was
obliged to promise her I would bring you. Will
you come?’</p>

<p>‘When?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-121-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Now ... at once.’</p>

<p>Litvinov merely made a gesture with his
hand.</p>

<p>‘Irina Pavlovna,’ pursued Potugin, ‘supposes
that the ... how can I express it ... the
environment, shall we say, in which you
found her the other day, was not likely to be
particularly attractive to you; but she told me
to tell you, that the devil is not so black as he
is fancied.’</p>

<p>‘Hm.... Does that saying apply strictly to
the environment?’</p>

<p>‘Yes ... and in general.’</p>

<p>‘Hm.... Well, and what is your opinion,
Sozont Ivanitch, of the devil?’</p>

<p>‘I think, Grigory Mihalitch, that he is in any
case not what he is fancied.’</p>

<p>‘Is he better?’</p>

<p>‘Whether better or worse it’s hard to say,
but certainly he is not the same as he is fancied.
Well, shall we go?’</p>

<p>‘Sit here a little first. I must own that it
still seems rather strange to me.’</p>

<p>‘What seems strange, may I make bold to
inquire?’</p>

<p>‘In what way can you have become a friend
of Irina Pavlovna?’</p>

<p>Potugin scanned himself.</p>

<p>‘With my appearance, and my position in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-122-</a></span>
society, it certainly does seem rather incredible;
but you know&mdash;Shakespeare has said already,
“There are more things in heaven and earth,
Horatio, etc.” Life too is not to be trifled with.
Here is a simile for you; a tree stands before
you when there is no wind; in what way can a
leaf on a lower branch touch a leaf on an upper
branch? It’s impossible. But when the storm
rises it is all changed ... and the two leaves
touch.’</p>

<p>‘Aha! So there were storms?’</p>

<p>‘I should think so! Can one live without
them? But enough of philosophy. It’s time
to go.’</p>

<p>Litvinov was still hesitating.</p>

<p>‘O good Lord!’ cried Potugin with a comic
face, ‘what are young men coming to nowadays!
A most charming lady invites them to
see her, sends messengers after them on purpose,
and they raise difficulties. You ought
to be ashamed, my dear sir, you ought to
be ashamed. Here’s your hat. Take it
and “Vorwärts,” as our ardent friends the
Germans say.’</p>

<p>Litvinov still stood irresolute for a moment,
but he ended by taking his hat and going out
of the room with Potugin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-123-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII</a></h2>


<p>They went to one of the best hotels in Baden
and asked for Madame Ratmirov. The porter
first inquired their names, and then answered
at once that ‘<i>die Frau Fürstin ist zu Hause</i>,’
and went himself to conduct them up the
staircase and knock at the door of the apartment
and announce them. ‘<i>Die Frau Fürstin</i>’
received them promptly: she was alone, her
husband had gone off to Carlsruhe for an interview
with a great official, an influential personage
who was passing through that town.</p>

<p>Irina was sitting at a small table, embroidering
on canvas when Potugin and Litvinov
crossed the threshold. She quickly flung her
embroidery aside, pushed away the little table
and got up; an expression of genuine pleasure
overspread her face. She wore a morning dress,
high at the neck; the superb lines of her
shoulders and arms could be seen through the
thin stuff; her carelessly-coiled hair had come
loose and fell low on her slender neck. Irina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-124-</a></span>
flung a swift glance at Potugin, murmured
‘<i>merci</i>,’ and holding out her hand to Litvinov
reproached him amicably for forgetfulness.</p>

<p>‘And you such an old friend!’ she added.</p>

<p>Litvinov was beginning to apologise. ‘<i>C’est
bien, c’est bien</i>,’ she assented hurriedly and,
taking his hat from him, with friendly insistence
made him sit down. Potugin, too, was
sitting down, but got up again directly, and
saying that he had an engagement he could
not put off, and that he would come in again
after dinner, he proceeded to take leave. Irina
again flung him a rapid glance, and gave him
a friendly nod, but she did not try to keep him,
and directly he had vanished behind the portière,
she turned with eager impatience to Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ she began, speaking
Russian in her soft musical voice, ‘here we
are alone at last, and I can tell you how glad
I am at our meeting, because it ... it gives
me a chance...’ (Irina looked him straight
in the face) ‘of asking your forgiveness.’</p>

<p>Litvinov gave an involuntary start. He had
not expected so swift an attack. He had not
expected she would herself turn the conversation
upon old times.</p>

<p>‘Forgiveness ... for what?’ ... he
muttered.</p>

<p>Irina flushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-125-</a></span></p>

<p>‘For what? ... you know for what,’ she
said, and she turned slightly away. ‘I wronged
you, Grigory Mihalitch ... though, of course,
it was my fate’ (Litvinov was reminded of her
letter) ‘and I do not regret it ... it would be
in any case too late; but, meeting you so unexpectedly,
I said to myself that we absolutely
must become friends, absolutely ... and I
should feel it deeply, if it did not come about
... and it seems to me for that we must have
an explanation, without putting it off, and once
for all, so that afterwards there should be no
... <i>gêne</i>, no awkwardness, once for all, Grigory
Mihalitch; and that you must tell me you forgive
me, or else I shall imagine you feel ...
<i>de la rancune</i>. <i>Voilà!</i> It is perhaps a great
piece of fatuity on my part, for you have
probably forgotten everything long, long
ago, but no matter, tell me, you have forgiven
me.’</p>

<p>Irina uttered this whole speech without
taking breath, and Litvinov could see that
there were tears shining in her eyes ... yes,
actually tears.</p>

<p>‘Really, Irina Pavlovna,’ he began hurriedly,
‘how can you beg my pardon, ask forgiveness?...
That is all past and buried, and I can only
feel astounded that, in the midst of all the
splendour which surrounds you, you have still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-126-</a></span>
preserved a recollection of the obscure companions
of your youth....’</p>

<p>‘Does it astound you?’ said Irina softly.</p>

<p>‘It touches me,’ Litvinov went on, ‘because
I could never have imagined&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘You have not told me you have forgiven me,
though,’ interposed Irina.</p>

<p>‘I sincerely rejoice at your happiness, Irina
Pavlovna. With my whole heart I wish you
all that is best on earth....’</p>

<p>‘And you will not remember evil against
me?’</p>

<p>‘I will remember nothing but the happy
moments for which I was once indebted to you.’</p>

<p>Irina held out both hands to him; Litvinov
clasped them warmly, and did not at once let
them go.... Something that long had not
been, secretly stirred in his heart at that soft
contact. Irina was again looking straight into
his face; but this time she was smiling....
And he for the first time gazed directly and
intently at her.... Again he recognised the
features once so precious, and those deep eyes,
with their marvellous lashes, and the little mole
on her cheek, and the peculiar growth of her
hair on her forehead, and her habit of somehow
sweetly and humorously curving her lips
and faintly twitching her eyebrows, all, all he
recognised.... But how beautiful she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-127-</a></span>
grown! What fascination, what power in her
fresh, woman’s body! And no rouge, no touching
up, no powder, nothing false on that fresh
pure face.... Yes, this was a beautiful woman.
A mood of musing came upon Litvinov....
He was still looking at her, but his thoughts
were far away.... Irina perceived it.</p>

<p>‘Well, that is excellent,’ she said aloud;
‘now my conscience is at rest then, and I can
satisfy my curiosity.’</p>

<p>‘Curiosity,’ repeated Litvinov, as though
puzzled.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes ... I want above all things to
know what you have been doing all this time,
what plans you have; I want to know all, how,
what, when ... all, all. And you will have to
tell me the truth, for I must warn you, I have
not lost sight of you ... so far as I could.’</p>

<p>‘You did not lose sight of me, you ... there
... in Petersburg?’</p>

<p>‘In the midst of the splendour which surrounded
me, as you expressed it just now. Positively,
yes, I did not. As for that splendour
we will talk about that again; but now you
must tell me, you must tell me so much, at
such length, no one will disturb us. Ah, how
delightful it will be,’ added Irina, gaily sitting
down and arranging herself at her ease in an
armchair. ‘Come, begin.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-128-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Before telling my story, I have to thank
you,’ began Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘What for?’</p>

<p>‘For the bouquet of flowers, which made its
appearance in my room.’</p>

<p>‘What bouquet? I know nothing about it.’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘I tell you I know nothing about it.... But
I am waiting.... I am waiting for your story....
Ah, what a good fellow that Potugin is to
have brought you!’</p>

<p>Litvinov pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>‘Have you known this Mr. Potugin long?’
he queried.</p>

<p>‘Yes, a long while ... but tell me your
story.’</p>

<p>‘And do you know him well?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes!’ Irina sighed. ‘There are special
reasons.... You have heard, of course, of
Eliza Byelsky.... Who died, you know, the
year before last, such a dreadful death?...
Ah, to be sure, I’d forgotten you don’t know
all our scandals.... It is well, it is well indeed,
that you don’t know them. <i>O quelle
chance!</i> at last, at last, a man, a live man, who
knows nothing of us! And to be able to talk
Russian with him, bad Russian of course, but
still Russian, not that everlasting, mawkish,
sickening French patter of Petersburg.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-129-</a></span></p>

<p>‘And Potugin, you say, was connected with&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘It’s very painful for me even to refer
to it,’ Irina broke in. ‘Eliza was my greatest
friend at school, and afterwards in Petersburg
we saw each other continually. She confided
all her secrets to me, she was very
unhappy, she suffered much. Potugin behaved
splendidly in the affair, with true chivalry.
He sacrificed himself. It was only then I
learnt to appreciate him! But we have drifted
away again. I am waiting for your story,
Grigory Mihalitch.’</p>

<p>‘But my story cannot interest you the
least, Irina Pavlovna.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not your affair.’</p>

<p>‘Think, Irina Pavlovna, we have not seen
each other for ten years, ten whole years.
How much water has flowed by since then.’</p>

<p>‘Not water only! not water only!’ she repeated
with a peculiar bitter expression; ‘that’s
just why I want to hear what you are going to
tell me.’</p>

<p>‘And beside I really don’t know where to
begin.’</p>

<p>‘At the beginning. From the very time when
you ... when I went away to Petersburg.
You left Moscow then.... Do you know I
have never been back to Moscow since!’</p>

<p>‘Really?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-130-</a></span></p>

<p>‘It was impossible at first; and afterwards
when I was married&mdash;&mdash;.’</p>

<p>‘Have you been married long?’</p>

<p>‘Four years.’</p>

<p>‘Have you no children?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered drily.</p>

<p>Litvinov was silent for a little.</p>

<p>‘And did you go on living at that, what
was his name, Count Reisenbach’s, till your
marriage?’</p>

<p>Irina looked steadily at him, as though she
were trying to make up her mind why he asked
that question.</p>

<p>‘No,’ ... was her answer at last.</p>

<p>‘I suppose, your parents.... By the way,
I haven’t asked after them. Are they&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘They are both well.’</p>

<p>‘And living at Moscow as before?’</p>

<p>‘At Moscow as before.’</p>

<p>‘And your brothers and sisters?’</p>

<p>‘They are all right; I have provided for all
of them.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ Litvinov glanced up from under his
brows at Irina. ‘In reality, Irina Pavlovna,
it’s not I who ought to tell my story, but you,
if only&mdash;&mdash;’ He suddenly felt embarrassed and
stopped.</p>

<p>Irina raised her hands to her face and turned
her wedding-ring round upon her finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-131-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well? I will not refuse,’ she assented at
last. ‘Some day ... perhaps.... But first
you ... because, do you see, though I tried to
follow you up, I know scarcely anything of you;
while of me ... well, of me you have heard
enough certainly. Haven’t you? I suppose
you have heard of me, tell me?’</p>

<p>‘You, Irina Pavlovna, occupied too conspicuous
a place in the world, not to be the
subject of talk ... especially in the provinces,
where I have been and where every rumour is
believed.’</p>

<p>‘And do you believe the rumours? And of
what kind were the rumours?’</p>

<p>‘To tell the truth, Irina Pavlovna, such
rumours very seldom reached me. I have led
a very solitary life.’</p>

<p>‘How so? why, you were in the Crimea, in
the militia?’</p>

<p>‘You know that too?’</p>

<p>‘As you see. I tell you, you have been
watched.’</p>

<p>Again Litvinov felt puzzled.</p>

<p>‘Why am I to tell you what you know without
me?’ said Litvinov in an undertone.</p>

<p>‘Why ... to do what I ask you. You see
I ask you, Grigory Mihalitch.’</p>

<p>Litvinov bowed his head and began ...
began in rather a confused fashion to recount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-132-</a></span>
in rough outline to Irina his uninteresting
adventures. He often stopped and looked
inquiringly at Irina, as though to ask whether
he had told enough. But she insistently demanded
the continuation of his narrative and
pushing her hair back behind her ears, her
elbows on the arm of her chair, she seemed to
be catching every word with strained attention.
Looking at her from one side and following the
expression on her face, any one might perhaps
have imagined she did not hear what Litvinov
was saying at all, but was only deep in meditation....
But it was not of Litvinov she was
meditating, though he grew confused and red
under her persistent gaze. A whole life was
rising up before her, a very different one, not
his life, but her own.</p>

<p>Litvinov did not finish his story, but stopped
short under the influence of an unpleasant sense
of growing inner discomfort. This time Irina
said nothing to him, and did not urge him to
go on, but pressing her open hand to her eyes,
as though she were tired, she leaned slowly
back in her chair, and remained motionless.
Litvinov waited for a little; then, reflecting that
his visit had already lasted more than two hours,
he was stretching out his hand for his hat, when
suddenly in an adjoining room there was the
sound of the rapid creak of thin kid boots, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">-133-</a></span>
preceded by the same exquisite aristocratic
perfume, there entered Valerian Vladimirovitch
Ratmirov.</p>

<p>Litvinov rose and interchanged bows with
the good-looking general, while Irina, with no
sign of haste, took her hand from her face, and
looking coldly at her husband, remarked in
French, ‘Ah! so you’ve come back! But
what time is it?’</p>

<p>‘Nearly four, <i>ma chère amie</i>, and you not
dressed yet&mdash;the princess will be expecting us,’
answered the general; and with an elegant bend
of his tightly-laced figure in Litvinov’s direction,
he added with the almost effeminate playfulness
of intonation characteristic of him, ‘It’s
clear an agreeable visitor has made you forgetful
of time.’</p>

<p>The reader will permit us at this point to
give him some information about General Ratmirov.
His father was the natural ... what
do you suppose? You are not wrong&mdash;but
we didn’t mean to say that ... the natural
son of an illustrious personage of the reign of
Alexander <span class="smaller">I.</span> and of a pretty little French actress.
The illustrious personage brought his son forward
in the world, but left him no fortune, and the
son himself (the father of our hero) had not time
to grow rich; he died before he had risen above
the rank of a colonel in the police. A year before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">-134-</a></span>
his death he had married a handsome young
widow who had happened to put herself under
his protection. His son by the widow, Valerian
Alexandrovitch, having got into the Corps of
Pages by favour, attracted the notice of the
authorities, not so much by his success in the
sciences, as by his fine bearing, his fine manners,
and his good behaviour (though he had been
exposed to all that pupils in the government
military schools were inevitably exposed to in
former days) and went into the Guards. His
career was a brilliant one, thanks to the discreet
gaiety of his disposition, his skill in dancing, his
excellent seat on horseback when an orderly
at reviews, and lastly, by a kind of special trick
of deferential familiarity with his superiors, of
tender, attentive almost clinging subservience,
with a flavour of vague liberalism, light as air....
This liberalism had not, however, prevented
him from flogging fifty peasants in a White
Russian village, where he had been sent to put
down a riot. His personal appearance was most
prepossessing and singularly youthful-looking;
smooth-faced and rosy-checked, pliant and
persistent, he made the most of his amazing success
with women; ladies of the highest rank and
mature age simply went out of their senses over
him. Cautious from habit, silent from motives
of prudence, General Ratmirov moved constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">-135-</a></span>
in the highest society, like the busy bee gathering
honey even from the least attractive flowers&mdash;and
without morals, without information of
any kind, but with the reputation of being good
at business; with an insight into men, and a
ready comprehension of the exigencies of the
moment, and above all, a never-swerving desire
for his own advantage, he saw at last all paths
lying open before him....</p>

<p>Litvinov smiled constrainedly, while Irina
merely shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said in the same cold tone, ‘did
you see the Count?’</p>

<p>‘To be sure I saw him. He told me to remember
him to you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! is he as imbecile as ever, that patron
of yours?’</p>

<p>General Ratmirov made no reply. He only
smiled to himself, as though lenient to the over-hastiness
of a woman’s judgment. With just
such a smile kindly-disposed grown-up people
respond to the nonsensical whims of children.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Irina went on, ‘the stupidity of your
friend the Count is too striking, even when one
has seen a good deal of the world.’</p>

<p>‘You sent me to him yourself,’ muttered the
general, and turning to Litvinov he asked him
in Russian, ‘Was he getting any benefit from
the Baden waters?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">-136-</a></span></p>

<p>‘I am in perfect health, I’m thankful to say,’
answered Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘That’s the greatest of blessings,’ pursued the
general, with an affable grimace; ‘and indeed
one doesn’t, as a rule, come to Baden for the
waters; but the waters here are very effectual,
<i>je veux dire, efficaces;</i> and any one who suffers,
as I do for instance, from a nervous cough&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Irina rose quickly. ‘We will see each other
again, Grigory Mihalitch, and I hope soon,’
she said in French, contemptuously cutting
short her husband’s speech, ‘but now I must
go and dress. That old princess is insufferable
with her everlasting <i>parties de plaisir</i>, of which
nothing comes but boredom.’</p>

<p>‘You’re hard on every one to-day,’ muttered
her husband, and he slipped away into the next
room.</p>

<p>Litvinov was turning towards the door....
Irina stopped him.</p>

<p>‘You have told me everything,’ she said, ‘but
the chief thing you concealed.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’</p>

<p>‘You are going to be married, I’m told?’</p>

<p>Litvinov blushed up to his ears.... As a
fact, he had intentionally not referred to Tanya;
but he felt horribly vexed, first, that Irina
knew about his marriage, and, secondly, that
she had, as it were, convicted him of a desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-137-</a></span>
conceal it from her. He was completely at a
loss what to say, while Irina did not take her
eyes off him.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am going to be married,’ he said at
last, and at once withdrew.</p>

<p>Ratmirov came back into the room.</p>

<p>‘Well, why aren’t you dressed?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘You can go alone; my head aches.’</p>

<p>‘But the princess....’</p>

<p>Irina scanned her husband from head to foot
in one look, turned her back upon him, and
went away to her boudoir.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-138-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov felt much annoyed with himself, as
though he had lost money at roulette, or failed
to keep his word. An inward voice told him
that he&mdash;on the eve of marriage, a man of sober
sense, not a boy&mdash;ought not to have given way
to the promptings of curiosity, nor the allurements
of recollection. ‘Much need there was
to go!’ he reflected. ‘On her side simply
flirtation, whim, caprice.... She’s bored,
she’s sick of everything, she clutched at me
... as some one pampered with dainties
will suddenly long for black bread ... well,
that’s natural enough.... But why did I go?
Can I feel anything but contempt for her?’
This last phrase he could not utter even in
thought without an effort.... ‘Of course,
there’s no kind of danger, and never could be,’
he pursued his reflections. ‘I know whom I
have to deal with. But still one ought not to
play with fire.... I’ll never set my foot in her
place again.’ Litvinov dared not, or could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">-139-</a></span>
as yet, confess to himself how beautiful Irina had
seemed to him, how powerfully she had worked
upon his feelings.</p>

<p>Again the day passed dully and drearily.
At dinner, Litvinov chanced to sit beside a
majestic <i>belhomme</i>, with dyed moustaches, who
said nothing, and only panted and rolled his
eyes ... but, being suddenly taken with a
hiccup, proved himself to be a fellow-countryman,
by at once exclaiming, with feeling, in
Russian, ‘There, I said I ought not to eat
melons!’ In the evening, too, nothing happened
to compensate for a lost day; Bindasov, before
Litvinov’s very eyes, won a sum four times
what he had borrowed from him, but, far from
repaying his debt, he positively glared in his
face with a menacing air, as though he were
prepared to borrow more from him just because
he had been a witness of his winnings. The
next morning he was again invaded by a host
of his compatriots; Litvinov got rid of them
with difficulty, and setting off to the mountains,
he first came across Irina&mdash;he pretended not to
recognise her, and passed quickly by&mdash;and then
Potugin. He was about to begin a conversation
with Potugin, but the latter did not respond to
him readily. He was leading by the hand a
smartly dressed little girl, with fluffy, almost
white curls, large black eyes, and a pale, sickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-140-</a></span>
little face, with that peculiar peremptory and
impatient expression characteristic of spoiled
children. Litvinov spent two hours in the
mountains, and then went back homewards
along the Lichtenthaler Allee.... A lady,
sitting on a bench, with a blue veil over her
face, got up quickly, and came up to him....
He recognised Irina.</p>

<p>‘Why do you avoid me, Grigory Mihalitch?’
she said, in the unsteady voice of one who is
boiling over within.</p>

<p>Litvinov was taken aback. ‘I avoid you,
Irina Pavlovna?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you ... you&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Irina seemed excited, almost angry.</p>

<p>‘You are mistaken, I assure you.’</p>

<p>‘No, I am not mistaken. Do you suppose
this morning&mdash;when we met, I mean&mdash;do you
suppose I didn’t see that you knew me? Do
you mean to say you did not know me? Tell
me.’</p>

<p>‘I really ... Irina Pavlovna&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch, you’re a straightforward
man, you have always told the truth; tell me,
tell me, you knew me, didn’t you? you turned
away on purpose?’</p>

<p>Litvinov glanced at Irina. Her eyes shone
with a strange light, while her cheeks and lips
were of a deathly pallor under the thick net of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-141-</a></span>
her veil. In the expression of her face, in the
very sound of her abruptly jerked-out whisper,
there was something so irresistibly mournful,
beseeching ... Litvinov could not pretend
any longer.</p>

<p>‘Yes ... I knew you,’ he uttered not
without effort.</p>

<p>Irina slowly shuddered, and slowly dropped
her hands.</p>

<p>‘Why did you not come up to me?’ she
whispered.</p>

<p>‘Why ... why!’ Litvinov moved on one
side, away from the path, Irina followed him in
silence. ‘Why?’ he repeated once more, and
suddenly his face was aflame, and he felt his
chest and throat choking with a passion akin
to hatred. ‘You ... you ask such a question,
after all that has passed between us? Not now,
of course, not now; but there ... there ... in
Moscow.’</p>

<p>‘But, you know, we decided; you know, you
promised&mdash;&mdash;’ Irina was beginning.</p>

<p>‘I have promised nothing! Pardon the
harshness of my expressions, but you ask for
the truth&mdash;so think for yourself: to what but a
caprice&mdash;incomprehensible, I confess, to me&mdash;to
what but a desire to try how much power
you still have over me, can I attribute your
... I don’t know what to call it ... your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">-142-</a></span>
persistence? Our paths have lain so far apart!
I have forgotten it all, I’ve lived through all
that suffering long ago, I’ve become a different
man completely; you are married&mdash;happy, at
least, in appearance&mdash;you fill an envied position
in the world; what’s the object, what’s the use
of our meeting? What am I to you? what are
you to me? We cannot even understand each
other now; there is absolutely nothing in
common between us now, neither in the past
nor in the present! Especially ... especially
in the past!’</p>

<p>Litvinov uttered all this speech hurriedly,
jerkily, without turning his head. Irina did
not stir, except from time to time she faintly
stretched her hands out to him. It seemed as
though she were beseeching him to stop and
listen to her, while, at his last words, she slightly
bit her lower lip, as though to master the pain
of a sharp, rapid wound.</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ she began at last, in a
calmer voice; and she moved still further away
from the path, along which people from time to
time passed.</p>

<p>Litvinov in his turn followed her.</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch, believe me, if I could
imagine I had one hair’s-breadth of power over
you left, I would be the first to avoid you. If
I have not done so, if I made up my mind, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">-143-</a></span>
spite of my ... of the wrong I did you in the
past, to renew my acquaintance with you, it was
because ... because&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Because what?’ asked Litvinov, almost
rudely.</p>

<p>‘Because,’ Irina declared with sudden force&mdash;‘it’s
too insufferable, too unbearably stifling for
me in society, in the envied position you talk
about; because meeting you, a live man, after
all these dead puppets&mdash;you have seen samples
of them three days ago, there <i>au Vieux Château</i>,&mdash;I
rejoice over you as an oasis in the desert,
while you suspect me of flirting, and despise
me and repulse me on the ground that I
wronged you&mdash;as indeed I did&mdash;but far more
myself!’</p>

<p>‘You chose your lot yourself, Irina Pavlovna,’
Litvinov rejoined sullenly, as before not turning
his head.</p>

<p>‘I chose it myself, yes ... and I don’t complain,
I have no right to complain,’ said Irina
hurriedly; she seemed to derive a secret consolation
from Litvinov’s very harshness. ‘I
know that you must think ill of me, and I won’t
justify myself; I only want to explain my
feeling to you, I want to convince you I am in
no flirting humour now.... Me flirting with
you! Why, there is no sense in it.... When
I saw you, all that was good, that was young in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-144-</a></span>
me, revived ... that time when I had not
yet chosen my lot, everything that lies behind
in that streak of brightness behind those ten
years....’</p>

<p>‘Come, really, Irina Pavlovna! So far as I
am aware, the brightness in your life began
precisely with the time we separated....’</p>

<p>Irina put her handkerchief to her lips.</p>

<p>‘That’s very cruel, what you say, Grigory
Mihalitch; but I can’t feel angry with you.
Oh, no, that was not a bright time, it was not for
happiness I left Moscow; I have known not
one moment, not one instant of happiness ...
believe me, whatever you have been told. If I
were happy, could I talk to you as I am talking
now.... I repeat to you, you don’t know what
these people are.... Why, they understand
nothing, feel for nothing; they’ve no intelligence
even, <i>ni esprit ni intelligence</i>, nothing but
tact and cunning; why, in reality, music and
poetry and art are all equally remote from
them.... You will say that I was rather
indifferent to all that myself; but not to the
same degree, Grigory Mihalitch ... not to the
same degree! It’s not a woman of the world
before you now, you need only look at me&mdash;not
a society queen.... That’s what they call us,
I believe ... but a poor, poor creature, really
deserving of pity. Don’t wonder at my words....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">-145-</a></span>
I am beyond feeling pride now! I hold
out my hand to you as a beggar, will you
understand, just as a beggar.... I ask for
charity,’ she added suddenly, in an involuntary,
irrepressible outburst, ‘I ask for charity,
and you&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Her voice broke. Litvinov raised his head
and looked at Irina; her breathing came quickly,
her lips were quivering. Suddenly his heart
beat fast, and the feeling of hatred vanished.</p>

<p>‘You say that our paths have lain apart,’
Irina went on. ‘I know you are about to marry
from inclination, you have a plan laid out for
your whole life; yes, that’s all so, but we have
not become strangers to one another, Grigory
Mihalitch; we can still understand each other.
Or do you imagine I have grown altogether
dull&mdash;altogether debased in the mire? Ah, no,
don’t think that, please! Let me open my
heart, I beseech you&mdash;there&mdash;even for the sake
of those old days, if you are not willing to forget
them. Do so, that our meeting may not have
come to pass in vain; that would be too bitter;
it would not last long in any case.... I don’t
know how to say it properly, but you will
understand me, because I ask for little, so little
... only a little sympathy, only that you
should not repulse me, that you should let me
open my heart&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-146-</a></span>&mdash;’</p>

<p>Irina ceased speaking, there were tears in
her voice. She sighed, and timidly, with a kind
of furtive, searching look, gazed at Litvinov,
held out her hand to him....</p>

<p>Litvinov slowly took the hand and faintly
pressed it.</p>

<p>‘Let us be friends,’ whispered Irina.</p>

<p>‘Friends,’ repeated Litvinov dreamily.</p>

<p>‘Yes, friends ... or if that is too much to
ask, then let us at least be friendly.... Let us
be simply as though nothing had happened.’</p>

<p>‘As though nothing had happened,...’
repeated Litvinov again. ‘You said just now,
Irina Pavlovna, that I was unwilling to forget the
old days.... But what if I can’t forget them?’</p>

<p>A blissful smile flashed over Irina’s face,
and at once disappeared, to be replaced by a
harassed, almost scared expression.</p>

<p>‘Be like me, Grigory Mihalitch, remember only
what was good in them; and most of all, give me
your word.... Your word of honour....’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Not to avoid me ... not to hurt me for
nothing. You promise? tell me!’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And you will dismiss all evil thoughts of me
from your mind.’</p>

<p>‘Yes ... but as for understanding you&mdash;I
give it up.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-147-</a></span></p>

<p>‘There’s no need of that ... wait a little,
though, you will understand. But you will
promise?’</p>

<p>‘I have said yes already.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks. You see I am used to believe you.
I shall expect you to-day, to-morrow, I will
not go out of the house. And now I must
leave you. The Grand Duchess is coming along
the avenue.... She’s caught sight of me, and
I can’t avoid going up to speak to her....
Good-bye till we meet.... Give me your
hand, <i>vite, vite</i>. Till we meet.’</p>

<p>And warmly pressing Litvinov’s hand, Irina
walked towards a middle-aged person of dignified
appearance, who was coming slowly along
the gravel path, escorted by two other ladies,
and a strikingly handsome groom in livery.</p>

<p>‘<i>Eh bonjour, chère Madame</i>,’ said the personage,
while Irina curtseyed respectfully to her.
‘<i>Comment allez-vous aujourd’hui? Venez un
peu avec moi.</i>’</p>

<p>‘<i>Votre Altesse a trop de bonté</i>,’ Irina’s insinuating
voice was heard in reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-148-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov let the Grand Duchess and all her
suite get out of sight, and then he too went
along the avenue. He could not make up his
mind clearly what he was feeling; he was conscious
both of shame and dread, while his vanity
was flattered.... The unexpected explanation
with Irina had taken him utterly by surprise;
her rapid burning words had passed over him
like a thunder-storm. ‘Queer creatures these
society women,’ he thought; ‘there’s no consistency
in them ... and how perverted they
are by the surroundings in which they go on
living, while they’re conscious of its hideousness
themselves!’... In reality he was not
thinking this at all, but only mechanically repeating
these hackneyed phrases, as though he
were trying to ward off other more painful
thoughts. He felt that he must not think
seriously just now, that he would probably have
to blame himself, and he moved with lagging
steps, almost forcing himself to pay attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-149-</a></span>
everything that happened to meet him....
He suddenly found himself before a seat, caught
sight of some one’s legs in front of it, and looked
upwards from them.... The legs belonged to
a man, sitting on the seat, and reading a newspaper;
this man turned out to be Potugin.
Litvinov uttered a faint exclamation. Potugin
laid the paper down on his knees, and looked
attentively, without a smile, at Litvinov; and
Litvinov also attentively, and also without a
smile, looked at Potugin.</p>

<p>‘May I sit by you?’ he asked at last.</p>

<p>‘By all means, I shall be delighted. Only I
warn you, if you want to have a talk with me,
you mustn’t be offended with me&mdash;I’m in a
most misanthropic humour just now, and I see
everything in an exaggeratedly repulsive light.’</p>

<p>‘That’s no matter, Sozont Ivanitch,’ responded
Litvinov, sinking down on the seat,
‘indeed it’s particularly appropriate.... But
why has such a mood come over you?’</p>

<p>‘I ought not by rights to be ill-humoured,’
began Potugin. ‘I’ve just read in the paper
a project for judicial reforms in Russia, and
I see with genuine pleasure that we’ve got
some sense at last, and they’re not as usual
on the pretext of independence, nationalism,
or originality, proposing to tack a little
home-made tag of our own on to the clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-150-</a></span>
straightforward logic of Europe; but are taking
what’s good from abroad intact. A single
adaptation in its application to the peasants’
sphere is enough.... There’s no doing away
with communal ownership!... Certainly,
certainly, I ought not to be ill-humoured; but
to my misfortune I chanced upon a Russian
“rough diamond,” and had a talk with him,
and these rough diamonds, these self-educated
geniuses, would make me turn in my grave!’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by a rough diamond?’
asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Why, there’s a gentleman disporting himself
here, who imagines he’s a musical genius.
“I have done nothing, of course,” he’ll tell you.
“I’m a cipher, because I’ve had no training,
but I’ve incomparably more melody and more
ideas in me than in Meyerbeer.” In the first
place, I say: why have you had no training?
and secondly, that, not to talk of Meyerbeer,
the humblest German flute-player, modestly
blowing his part in the humblest German
orchestra, has twenty times as many ideas as
all our untaught geniuses; only the flute-player
keeps his ideas to himself, and doesn’t trot
them out with a flourish in the land of Mozarts
and Haydns; while our friend the rough
diamond has only to strum some little waltz or
song, and at once you see him with his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-151-</a></span>
in his trouser pocket and a sneer of contempt
on his lips: I’m a genius, he says. And in
painting it’s just the same, and in everything
else. Oh, these natural geniuses, how I hate
them! As if every one didn’t know that it’s
only where there’s no real science fully assimilated,
and no real art, that there’s this flaunting
affectation of them. Surely it’s time to have
done with this flaunting, this vulgar twaddle,
together with all hackneyed phrases such as
“no one ever dies of hunger in Russia,” “nowhere
is there such fast travelling as in Russia,” “we
Russians could bury all our enemies under our
hats.” I’m for ever hearing of the richness of
the Russian nature, their unerring instinct, and
of Kulibin.... But what is this richness, after
all, gentlemen? Half-awakened mutterings or
else half-animal sagacity. Instinct, indeed!
A fine boast. Take an ant in a forest and set
it down a mile from its ant-hill, it will find its
way home; man can do nothing like it; but
what of it? do you suppose he’s inferior to
the ant? Instinct, be it ever so unerring, is
unworthy of man; sense, simple, straightforward,
common sense&mdash;that’s our heritage, our
pride; sense won’t perform any such tricks,
but it’s that that everything rests upon. As
for Kulibin, who without any knowledge of
mechanics succeeded in making some very bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-152-</a></span>
watches, why, I’d have those watches set up in
the pillory, and say: see, good people, this is the
way <i>not</i> to do it. Kulibin’s not to blame for it,
but his work’s rubbish. To admire Telushkin’s
boldness and cleverness because he climbed on
to the Admiralty spire is well enough; why
not admire him? But there’s no need to shout
that he’s made the German architects look
foolish, that they’re no good, except at making
money.... He’s not made them look foolish
in the least; they had to put a scaffolding
round the spire afterwards, and repair it in the
usual way. For mercy’s sake, never encourage
the idea in Russia that anything can be done
without training. No; you may have the brain
of a Solomon, but you must study, study from
the A B C. Or else hold your tongue, and sit
still, and be humble! Phoo! it makes one hot
all over!’</p>

<p>Potugin took off his hat and began fanning
himself with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘Russian art,’ he began again. ‘Russian art,
indeed!... Russian impudence and conceit, I
know, and Russian feebleness too, but Russian
art, begging your pardon, I’ve never come
across. For twenty years on end they’ve
been doing homage to that bloated nonentity
Bryullov, and fancying that we have founded
a school of our own, and even that it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-153-</a></span>
better than all others.... Russian art, ha,
ha, ha! ho, ho!’</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, though, Sozont Ivanitch,’ remarked
Litvinov, ‘would you refuse to recognise
Glinka too, then?’</p>

<p>Potugin scratched his head.</p>

<p>‘The exception, you know, only proves the
rule, but even in that instance we could not
dispense with bragging. If we’d said, for
example, that Glinka was really a remarkable
musician, who was only prevented by circumstances&mdash;outer
and inner&mdash;from becoming the
founder of the Russian opera, none would have
disputed it; but no, that was too much to
expect! They must at once raise him to the
dignity of commander-in-chief, of grand-marshal,
in the musical world, and disparage other
nations while they were about it; they have
nothing to compare with him, they declare, then
quote you some marvellous home-bred genius
whose compositions are nothing but a poor
imitation of second-rate foreign composers, yes,
second-rate ones, for they’re the easiest to
imitate. Nothing to compare with him? Oh,
poor benighted barbarians, for whom standards
in art are non-existent, and artists are something
of the same species as the strong man
Rappo: there’s a foreign prodigy, they say,
can lift fifteen stone in one hand, but our man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-154-</a></span>
can lift thirty! Nothing to compare with us,
indeed! I will venture to tell you some
thing I remember, and can’t get out of my head.
Last spring I visited the Crystal Palace near
London; in that Palace, as you’re aware,
there’s a sort of exhibition of everything that
has been devised by the ingenuity of man&mdash;an
encyclopædia of humanity one might call it.
Well, I walked to and fro among the machines
and implements and statues of great men; and
all the while I thought, if it were decreed that
some nation or other should disappear from the
face of the earth, and with it everything that
nation had invented, should disappear from the
Crystal Palace, our dear mother, Holy Russia,
could go and hide herself in the lower regions,
without disarranging a single nail in the place:
everything might remain undisturbed where it
is; for even the <i>samovar</i>, the woven bast shoes,
the yoke-bridle, and the knout&mdash;these are our
famous products&mdash;were not invented by us.
One could not carry out the same experiment
on the Sandwich islanders; those islanders have
made some peculiar canoes and javelins of their
own; their absence would be noticed by visitors.
It’s a libel! it’s too severe, you say perhaps....
But I say, first, I don’t know how to roar
like any sucking dove; and secondly, it’s plain
that it’s not only the devil no one dares to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-155-</a></span>
straight in the face, for no one dares to look
straight at himself, and it’s not only children
who like being soothed to sleep. Our older
inventions came to us from the East, our later
ones we’ve borrowed, and half spoiled, from the
West, while we still persist in talking about
the independence of Russian art! Some bold
spirits have even discovered an original Russian
science; twice two makes four with us as elsewhere,
but the result’s obtained more ingeniously,
it appears.’</p>

<p>‘But wait a minute, Sozont Ivanitch,’ cried
Litvinov. ‘Do wait a minute! You know we
send something to the universal exhibitions,
and doesn’t Europe import something from us.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, raw material, raw products. And note,
my dear sir: this raw produce of ours is generally
only good by virtue of other exceedingly
bad conditions; our bristles, for instance, are
large and strong, because our pigs are poor;
our hides are stout and thick because our cows
are thin; our tallow’s rich because it’s boiled
down with half the flesh.... But why am I
enlarging on that to you, though; you are a
student of technology, to be sure, you must
know all that better than I do. They talk to
me of our inventive faculty! The inventive
faculty of the Russians! Why our worthy
farmers complain bitterly and suffer loss because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-156-</a></span>
there’s no satisfactory machine for drying
grain in existence, to save them from the
necessity of putting their sheaves in ovens, as
they did in the days of Rurik; these ovens
are fearfully wasteful&mdash;just as our bast shoes
and our Russian mats are,&mdash;and they are constantly
getting on fire. The farmers complain,
but still there’s no sign of a drying-machine.
And why is there none? Because the German
farmer doesn’t need them; he can thrash his
wheat as it is, so he doesn’t bother to invent
one, and we ... are not capable of doing it!
Not capable&mdash;and that’s all about it! Try as
we may! From this day forward I declare
whenever I come across one of those rough
diamonds, these self-taught geniuses, I shall
say: “Stop a minute, my worthy friend!
Where’s that drying-machine? let’s have it!”
But that’s beyond them! Picking up some old
cast-off shoe, dropped ages ago by St. Simon
or Fourier, and sticking it on our heads and
treating it as a sacred relic&mdash;that’s what we’re
capable of; or scribbling an article on the
historical and contemporary significance of the
proletariat in the principal towns of France&mdash;that
we can do too; but I tried once, asking a
writer and political economist of that sort&mdash;rather
like your friend, Mr. Voroshilov&mdash;to
mention twenty towns in France, and what do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-157-</a></span>
you think came of that? Why the economist
in despair at last mentioned Mont-Fermeuil as
one of the French towns, remembering it probably
from some novel of Paul de Kock’s. And
that reminds me of the following anecdote. I
was one day strolling through a wood with a
dog and a gun&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Are you a sportsman then?’ asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘I shoot a little. I was making my way to a
swamp in search of snipe; I’d been told of the
swamp by other sportsmen. I saw sitting in
a clearing before a hut a timber merchant’s
clerk, as fresh and smooth as a peeled nut, he
was sitting there, smiling away&mdash;what at, I
can’t say. So I asked him: “Whereabouts
was the swamp, and were there many snipe in
it?” “To be sure, to be sure,” he sang out
promptly, and with an expression of face as
though I’d given him a rouble; “the swamp’s
first-rate, I’m thankful to say; and as for all
kinds of wild fowl,&mdash;my goodness, they’re to be
found there in wonderful plenty.” I set off,
but not only found no wild fowl, the swamp
itself had been dry for a long time. Now tell
me, please, why is the Russian a liar? Why
does the political economist lie, and why the lie
about the wild fowl too?’</p>

<p>Litvinov made no answer, but only sighed
sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">-158-</a></span></p>

<p>‘But turn the conversation with the same
political economist,’ pursued Potugin, ‘on the
most abstruse problems of social science, keeping
to theory, without facts...!&mdash;he takes
flight like a bird, a perfect eagle. I did once
succeed, though, in catching one of those birds.
I used a pretty snare, though an obvious one,
as you shall see if you please. I was talking
with one of our latter-day “new young men”
about various questions, as they call them.
Well, he got very hot, as they always do.
Marriage among other things he attacked with
really childish exasperation. I brought forward
one argument after another.... I might as
well have talked to a stone wall! I saw I
should never get round him like that. And
then I had a happy thought! “Allow me to
submit to you,” I began,&mdash;one must always talk
very respectfully to these “new young men”&mdash;“I
am really surprised at you, my dear sir; you
are studying natural science, and your attention
has never up till now been caught by the
fact that all carnivorous and predatory animals&mdash;wild
beasts and birds&mdash;all who have to go
out in search of prey, and to exert themselves
to obtain animal food for themselves and their
young ... and I suppose you would include
man in the category of such animals?” “Of
course, I should,” said the “new young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-159-</a></span>”
“man is nothing but a carnivorous animal.”
“And predatory?” I added. “And predatory,”
he declared. “Well said,” I observed. “Well,
then I am surprised you’ve never noticed that
such animals live in monogamy.” The “new
young man” started. “How so?” “Why, it is
so. Think of the lion, the wolf, the fox, the
vulture, the kite; and, indeed, would you condescend
to suggest how they could do otherwise.
It’s hard work enough for the two
together to get a living for their offspring.”
My “new young man” grew thoughtful. “Well,”
says he, “in that case the animal is not a rule
for man.” Thereupon I called him an idealist,
and wasn’t he hurt at that! He almost cried.
I had to comfort him by promising not to tell
of him to his friends. To deserve to be called
an idealist is no laughing matter! The main
point in which our latter-day young people are
out in their reckoning is this. They fancy that
the time for the old, obscure, underground work
is over, that it was all very well for their old-fashioned
fathers to burrow like moles, but
that’s too humiliating a part for us, we will
take action in the light of day, we will take
action.... Poor darlings! why your children
even won’t take action; and don’t you care to
go back to burrowing, burrowing underground
again in the old tracks?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-160-</a></span></p>

<p>A brief silence followed.</p>

<p>‘I am of opinion, my dear sir,’ began Potugin
again, ‘that we are not only indebted to civilisation
for science, art, and law, but that even the
very feeling for beauty and poetry is developed
and strengthened under the influence of the
same civilisation, and that the so-called popular,
simple, unconscious creation is twaddling and
rubbishy. Even in Homer there are traces of
a refined and varied civilisation; love itself is
enriched by it. The Slavophils would cheerfully
hang me for such a heresy, if they were
not such chicken-hearted creatures; but I will
stick up for my own ideas all the same; and
however much they press Madame Kohanovsky
and “The swarm of bees at rest” upon me,&mdash;I
can’t stand the odour of that <i>triple extrait de
mougik Russe</i>, as I don’t belong to the highest
society, which finds it absolutely necessary to
assure itself from time to time that it has not
turned quite French, and for whose exclusive
benefit this literature <i>en cuir de Russie</i> is manufactured.
Try reading the raciest, most “popular”
passages from the “Bees” to a common
peasant&mdash;a real one; he’ll think you’re repeating
him a new spell against fever or drunkenness.
I repeat, without civilisation there’s
not even poetry. If you want to get a clear
idea of the poetic ideal of the uncivilised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">-161-</a></span>
Russian, you should turn up our ballads, our
legends. To say nothing of the fact that love
is always presented as the result of witchcraft,
of sorcery, and produced by some philtre, to
say nothing of our so-called epic literature
being the only one among all the European
and Asiatic literatures&mdash;the only one, observe,
which does not present any typical pair of
lovers&mdash;unless you reckon Vanka-Tanka as
such; and of the Holy Russian knight always
beginning his acquaintance with his destined
bride by beating her “most pitilessly” on her
white body, because “the race of women is
puffed up”! all that I pass over; but I should
like to call your attention to the artistic form
of the young hero, the <i>jeune premier</i>, as he was
depicted by the imagination of the primitive,
uncivilised Slav. Just fancy him a minute;
the <i>jeune premier</i> enters; a cloak he has worked
himself of sable, back-stitched along every seam,
a sash of seven-fold silk girt close about his
armpits, his fingers hidden away under his hanging
sleevelets, the collar of his coat raised high
above his head, from before, his rosy face no man
can see, nor, from behind, his little white neck;
his cap is on one ear, while on his feet are boots
of morocco, with points as sharp as a cobbler’s
awl, and the heels peaked like nails. Round
the points an egg can be rolled, and a sparrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">-162-</a></span>
can fly under the heels. And the young hero
advances with that peculiar mincing gait by
means of which our Alcibiades, Tchivilo Plenkovitch,
produced such a striking, almost medical,
effect on old women and young girls, the same
gait which we see in our loose-limbed waiters,
that cream, that flower of Russian dandyism,
that <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Russian taste. This I
maintain without joking; a sack-like gracefulness,
that’s an artistic ideal. What do
you think, is it a fine type? Does it present
many materials for painting, for sculpture?
And the beauty who fascinates the young
hero, whose “face is as red as the blood of
the hare”?... But I think you’re not listening
to me?’</p>

<p>Litvinov started. He had not, in fact, heard
what Potugin was saying; he kept thinking,
persistently thinking of Irina, of his last interview
with her....</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, Sozont Ivanitch,’ he
began, ‘but I’m going to attack you again
with my former question about ... about
Madame Ratmirov.’</p>

<p>Potugin folded up his newspaper and put it
in his pocket.</p>

<p>‘You want to know again how I came to
know her?’</p>

<p>‘No, not exactly. I should like to hear your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">-163-</a></span>
opinion ... on the part she played in Petersburg.
What was that part, in reality?’</p>

<p>‘I really don’t know what to say to you, Grigory
Mihalitch; I was brought into rather
intimate terms with Madame Ratmirov ... but
quite accidentally, and not for long. I never got
an insight into her world, and what took place
in it remained unknown to me. There was
some gossip before me, but as you know, it’s
not only in democratic circles that slander
reigns supreme among us. Besides I was not
inquisitive. I see though,’ he added, after a
short silence, ‘she interests you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; we have twice talked together rather
openly. I ask myself, though, is she sincere?’</p>

<p>Potugin looked down. ‘When she is carried
away by feeling, she is sincere, like all women
of strong passions. Pride too, sometimes prevents
her from lying.’</p>

<p>‘Is she proud? I should rather have supposed
she was capricious.’</p>

<p>‘Proud as the devil; but that’s no harm.’</p>

<p>‘I fancy she sometimes exaggerates....’</p>

<p>‘That’s nothing either, she’s sincere all
the same. Though after all, how can you
expect truth? The best of those society
women are rotten to the marrow of their
bones.’</p>

<p>‘But, Sozont Ivanitch, if you remember, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-164-</a></span>
called yourself her friend. Didn’t you drag me
almost by force to go and see her?’</p>

<p>‘What of that? she asked me to get hold of
you; and I thought, why not? And I really
am her friend. She has her good qualities:
she’s very kind, that is to say, generous, that’s
to say she gives others what she has no sort of
need of herself. But of course you must know
her at least as well as I do.’</p>

<p>‘I used to know Irina Pavlovna ten years ago;
but since then&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Grigory Mihalitch, why do you say
that? Do you suppose any one’s character
changes? Such as one is in one’s cradle, such
one is still in one’s tomb. Or perhaps it is’
(here Potugin bowed his head still lower) ‘perhaps,
you’re afraid of falling into her clutches?
that’s certainly ... But of course one is bound
to fall into some woman’s clutches.’</p>

<p>Litvinov gave a constrained laugh. ‘You
think so?’</p>

<p>‘There’s no escape. Man is weak, woman is
strong, opportunity is all-powerful, to make up
one’s mind to a joyless life is hard, to forget
oneself utterly is impossible ... and on one
side is beauty and sympathy and warmth and
light,&mdash;how is one to resist it? Why, one runs
like a child to its nurse. Ah, well, afterwards
to be sure comes cold and darkness and emptiness ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-165-</a></span>
in due course. And you end by being
strange to everything, by losing comprehension
of everything. At first you don’t understand
how love is possible; afterwards one won’t
understand how life is possible.’</p>

<p>Litvinov looked at Potugin, and it struck
him that he had never yet met a man more
lonely, more desolate ... more unhappy. This
time he was not shy, he was not stiff; downcast
and pale, his head on his breast, and his hands
on his knees, he sat without moving, merely
smiling his dejected smile. Litvinov felt sorry
for the poor, embittered, eccentric creature.</p>

<p>‘Irina Pavlovna mentioned among other
things,’ he began in a low voice, ‘a very intimate
friend of hers, whose name if I remember was
Byelsky, or Dolsky....’</p>

<p>Potugin raised his mournful eyes and looked
at Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ he commented thickly.... ‘She mentioned
... well, what of it? It’s time, though,’
he added with a rather artificial yawn, ‘for me
to be getting home&mdash;to dinner. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>He jumped up from the seat and made off
quickly before Litvinov had time to utter a
word.... His compassion gave way to annoyance&mdash;annoyance
with himself, be it understood.
Want of consideration of any kind was foreign
to his nature; he had wished to express his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-166-</a></span>
sympathy for Potugin, and it had resulted in
something like a clumsy insinuation. With
secret dissatisfaction in his heart, he went back
to his hotel.</p>

<p>‘Rotten to the marrow of her bones,’ he
thought a little later ... ‘but proud as the
devil! She, that woman who is almost on her
knees to me, proud? proud and not capricious?’</p>

<p>Litvinov tried to drive Irina’s image out of
his head, but he did not succeed. For this very
reason he did not think of his betrothed; he
felt to-day this haunting image would not give
up its place. He made up his mind to await
without further anxiety the solution of all this
‘strange business’; the solution could not be
long in coming, and Litvinov had not the
slightest doubt it would turn out to be most
innocent and natural. So he fancied, but
meanwhile he was not only haunted by Lina’s
image&mdash;every word she had uttered kept recurring
in its turn to his memory.</p>

<p>The waiter brought him a note: it was from
the same Irina:</p>

<p>‘If you have nothing to do this evening,
come to me; I shall not be alone; I shall
have guests, and you will get a closer view of
our set, our society. I want you very much
to see something of them; I fancy they will
show themselves in all their brilliance. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">-167-</a></span>
ought to know what sort of atmosphere I am
breathing. Come; I shall be glad to see you,
and you will not be bored. (Irina had spelt
the Russian incorrectly here.) Prove to me
that our explanation to-day has made any sort
of misunderstanding between us impossible
for ever.&mdash;Yours devotedly, <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I.</span></p>

<p>Litvinov put on a frock coat and a white tie,
and set off to Irina’s. ‘All this is of no importance,’
he repeated mentally on the way, ‘as for
looking at <i>them</i> ... why shouldn’t I have a
look at them? It will be curious.’ A few days
before, these very people had aroused a different
sensation in him; they had aroused his indignation.</p>

<p>He walked with quickened steps, his cap pulled
down over his eyes, and a constrained smile on
his lips, while Bambaev, sitting before Weber’s
café, and pointing him out from a distance to
Voroshilov and Pishtchalkin, cried excitedly:
‘Do you see that man? He’s a stone! he’s a
rock! he’s a flint!!!’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-168-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov found rather many guests at Irina’s.
In a corner at a card-table were sitting three
of the generals of the picnic: the stout one,
the irascible one, and the condescending one.
They were playing whist with dummy, and there
is no word in the language of man to express
the solemnity with which they dealt, took tricks,
led clubs and led diamonds ... there was no
doubt about their being statesmen now! These
gallant generals left to mere commoners, <i>aux
bourgeois</i>, the little turns and phrases commonly
used during play, and uttered only the most indispensable
syllables; the stout general however
permitted himself to jerk off between two
deals: ‘<i>Ce satané as de pique!</i>’ Among the
visitors Litvinov recognised ladies who had
been present at the picnic; but there were
others there also whom he had not seen before.
There was one so ancient that it seemed every
instant as though she would fall to pieces:
she shrugged her bare, gruesome, dingy grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-169-</a></span>
shoulders, and, covering her mouth with her fan,
leered languishingly with her absolutely death-like
eyes upon Ratmirov; he paid her much
attention; she was held in great honour in the
highest society, as the last of the Maids of
Honour of the Empress Catherine. At the
window, dressed like a shepherdess, sat Countess
S., ‘the Queen of the Wasps,’ surrounded by
young men. Among them the celebrated
millionaire and beau Finikov was conspicuous
for his supercilious deportment, his absolutely
flat skull, and his expression of soulless
brutality, worthy of a Khan of Bucharia, or
a Roman Heliogabalus. Another lady, also
a countess, known by the pet name of <i>Lise</i>, was
talking to a long-haired, fair, and pale spiritualistic
medium. Beside them was standing a
gentleman, also pale and long-haired, who kept
laughing in a meaning way. This gentleman
also believed in spiritualism, but added to that
an interest in prophecy, and, on the basis of
the Apocalypse and the Talmud, was in the
habit of foretelling all kinds of marvellous events.
Not a single one of these events had come to
pass; but he was in no wise disturbed by that
fact, and went on prophesying as before. At
the piano, the musical genius had installed himself,
the rough diamond, who had stirred Potugin
to such indignation; he was striking chords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-170-</a></span>
with a careless hand, <i>d’une main distraite</i>, and
kept staring vaguely about him. Irina was sitting
on a sofa between Prince Kokó and
Madame H., once a celebrated beauty and
wit, who had long ago become a repulsive old
crone, with the odour of sanctity and evaporated
sinfulness about her. On catching sight
of Litvinov, Irina blushed and got up, and
when he went up to her, she pressed his hand
warmly. She was wearing a dress of black
crépon, relieved by a few inconspicuous gold
ornaments; her shoulders were a dead white,
while her face, pale too, under the momentary
flood of crimson overspreading it, was breathing
with the triumph of beauty, and not of beauty
alone; a hidden, almost ironical happiness was
shining in her half-closed eyes, and quivering
about her lips and nostrils....</p>

<p>Ratmirov approached Litvinov and after
exchanging with him his customary civilities,
unaccompanied however by his customary playfulness,
he presented him to two or three ladies:
the ancient ruin, the Queen of the Wasps, Countess
Liza ... they gave him a rather gracious
reception. Litvinov did not belong to their
set; but he was good-looking, extremely so,
indeed, and the expressive features of his youthful
face awakened their interest. Only he did
not know how to fasten that interest upon himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">-171-</a></span>
he was unaccustomed to society and was
conscious of some embarrassment, added to
which the stout general stared at him persistently.
‘Aha! lubberly civilian! free-thinker!’
that fixed heavy stare seemed to be saying:
‘down on your knees to us; crawl to kiss our
hands!’ Irina came to Litvinov’s aid. She managed
so adroitly that he got into a corner near
the door, a little behind her. As she addressed
him, she had each time to turn round to him,
and every time he admired the exquisite curve
of her splendid neck, he drank in the subtle
fragrance of her hair. An expression of gratitude,
deep and calm, never left her face; he
could not help seeing that gratitude and nothing
else was what those smiles, those glances
expressed, and he too was all aglow with the
same emotion, and he felt shame, and delight and
dread at once ... and at the same time she
seemed continually as though she would ask,
‘Well? what do you think of them?’ With
special clearness Litvinov heard this unspoken
question whenever any one of the party was
guilty of some vulgar phrase or act, and that
occurred more than once during the evening.
Once she did not even conceal her feelings, and
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Countess Liza, a lady of superstitious bent,
with an inclination for everything extraordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-172-</a></span>
after discoursing to her heart’s content with the
spiritualist upon Home, turning tables, self-playing
concertinas, and so on, wound up by
asking him whether there were animals which
could be influenced by mesmerism.</p>

<p>‘There is one such animal any way,’ Prince
Kokó declared from some way off. ‘You know
Melvanovsky, don’t you? They put him to
sleep before me, and didn’t he snore, he,
he!’</p>

<p>‘You are very naughty, <i>mon prince;</i> I am
speaking of real animals, <i>je parle des bêtes</i>.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Mais moi aussi, madame, je parle d’une
bête....</i>’</p>

<p>‘There are such,’ put in the spiritualist; ‘for
instance&mdash;crabs; they are very nervous, and
are easily thrown into a cataleptic state.’</p>

<p>The countess was astounded. ‘What?
Crabs! Really? Oh, that’s awfully interesting!
Now, that I should like to see, M’sieu
Luzhin,’ she added to a young man with a face
as stony as a new doll’s, and a stony collar (he
prided himself on the fact that he had bedewed
the aforesaid face and collar with the sprays of
Niagara and the Nubian Nile, though he remembered
nothing of all his travels, and cared
for nothing but Russian puns...). ‘M’sieu
Luzhin, if you would be so good, do bring us a
crab quick.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-173-</a></span></p>

<p>M’sieu Luzhin smirked. ‘Quick must it be,
or quickly?’ he queried.</p>

<p>The countess did not understand him. ‘<i>Mais
oui</i>, a crab,’ she repeated, ‘<i>une écrevisse</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Eh? what is it? a crab? a crab?’ the
Countess S. broke in harshly. The absence of
M. Verdier irritated her; she could not imagine
why Irina had not invited that most fascinating
of Frenchmen. The ancient ruin, who had long
since ceased understanding anything&mdash;moreover
she was completely deaf&mdash;only shook her head.</p>

<p>‘<i>Oui, oui, vous allez voir.</i> M’sieu Luzhin,
please....’</p>

<p>The young traveller bowed, went out, and returned
quickly. A waiter walked behind him,
and grinning from ear to ear, carried in a dish,
on which a large black crab was to be seen.</p>

<p>‘<i>Voici, madame</i>,’ cried Luzhin; ‘now we can
proceed to the operation on cancer. Ha, ha,
ha!’ (Russians are always the first to laugh at
their own witticisms.)</p>

<p>‘He, he, he!’ Count Kokó did his duty condescendingly
as a good patriot, and patron of
all national products.</p>

<p>(We beg the reader not to be amazed and indignant;
who can say confidently for himself
that sitting in the stalls of the Alexander
Theatre, and infected by its atmosphere, he has
not applauded even worse puns?)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-174-</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>Merci, merci</i>,’ said the countess. ‘<i>Allons,
allons, Monsieur Fox, montrez nous ça.</i>’</p>

<p>The waiter put the dish down on a little
round table. There was a slight movement
among the guests; several heads were craned
forward; only the generals at the card-table
preserved the serene solemnity of their pose.
The spiritualist ruffled up his hair, frowned, and,
approaching the table, began waving his hands
in the air; the crab stretched itself, backed,
and raised its claws. The spiritualist repeated
and quickened his movements; the crab
stretched itself as before.</p>

<p>‘<i>Mais que doit-elle donc faire?</i>’ inquired the
countess.</p>

<p>‘<i>Elle doâ rester immobile et se dresser sur sa
quiou</i>,’ replied Mr. Fox, with a strong American
accent, and he brandished his fingers with convulsive
energy over the dish; but the mesmerism
had no effect, the crab continued to move. The
spiritualist declared that he was not himself, and
retired with an air of displeasure from the table.
The countess began to console him, by assuring
him that similar failures occurred sometimes
even with Mr. Home.... Prince Kokó confirmed
her words. The authority on the
Apocalypse and the Talmud stealthily went
up to the table, and making rapid but vigorous
thrusts with his fingers in the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-175-</a></span>
crab, he too tried his luck, but without success;
no symptom of catalepsy showed itself. Then
the waiter was called, and told to take away the
crab, which he accordingly did, grinning from
ear to ear, as before; he could be heard exploding
outside the door.... There was much
laughter afterwards in the kitchen <i>über diese
Russen</i>. The self-taught genius, who had gone
on striking notes during the experiments with
the crab, dwelling on melancholy chords, on the
ground that there was no knowing what influence
music might have&mdash;the self-taught genius
played his invariable waltz, and, of course, was
deemed worthy of the most flattering applause.
Pricked on by rivalry, Count H., our incomparable
dilettante (see Chapter <span class="smaller">I.</span>), gave a little song
of his own composition, cribbed wholesale from
Offenbach. Its playful refrain to the words:
‘<i>Quel œuf? quel bœuf?</i>’ set almost all the ladies’
heads swinging to right and to left; one went
so far as to hum the tune lightly, and the irrepressible,
inevitable word, ‘<i>Charmant! charmant!</i>’
was fluttering on every one’s lips. Irina
exchanged a glance with Litvinov, and again
the same secret, ironical expression quivered
about her lips.... But a little later it was still
more strongly marked, there was even a shade
of malice in it, when Prince Kokó, that representative
and champion of the interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-176-</a></span>
nobility, thought fit to propound his views to
the spiritualist, and, of course, gave utterance
before long to his famous phrase about the
shock to the principle of property, accompanied
naturally by an attack on democrats. The
spiritualist’s American blood was stirred; he
began to argue. The prince, as his habit was,
at once fell to shouting at the top of his voice;
instead of any kind of argument he repeated
incessantly: ‘<i>C’est absurde! cela n’a pas le sens
commun!</i>’ The millionaire Finikov began saying
insulting things, without much heed to whom
they referred; the Talmudist’s piping notes and
even the Countess S.’s jarring voice could be
heard.... In fact, almost the same incongruous
uproar arose as at Gubaryov’s; the only
difference was that here there was no beer nor
tobacco-smoke, and every one was better
dressed. Ratmirov tried to restore tranquillity
(the generals manifested their displeasure, Boris’s
exclamation could be heard, ‘<i>Encore cette satanée
politique!</i>’), but his efforts were not successful,
and at that point, a high official of the stealthily
inquisitorial type, who was present, and undertook
to present <i>le résumé en peu de mots</i>,
sustained a defeat: in fact he so hummed
and hawed, so repeated himself, and was so
obviously incapable of listening to or taking in
the answers he received, and so unmistakably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">-177-</a></span>
failed to perceive himself what precisely constituted
<i>la question</i> that no other result could
possibly have been anticipated. And then too
Irina was slily provoking the disputants and
setting them against one another, constantly
exchanging glances and slight signs with Litvinov
as she did so.... But he was sitting like
one spell-bound, he was hearing nothing, and
waiting for nothing but for those splendid eyes
to sparkle again, that pale, tender, mischievous,
exquisite face to flash upon him again....
It ended by the ladies growing restive, and requesting
that the dispute should cease....
Ratmirov entreated the dilettante to sing his
song again, and the self-taught genius once
more played his waltz....</p>

<p>Litvinov stayed till after midnight, and went
away later than all the rest. The conversation
had in the course of the evening touched upon
a number of subjects, studiously avoiding anything
of the faintest interest; the generals, after
finishing their solemn game, solemnly joined in
it: the influence of these statesmen was at
once apparent. The conversation turned upon
notorieties of the Parisian demi-monde, with
whose names and talents every one seemed
intimately acquainted, on Sardou’s latest play,
on a novel of About’s, on Patti in the <i>Traviata</i>.
Some one proposed a game of ‘secretary,’ <i>au</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-178-</a></span>
<i>secrétaire;</i> but it was not a success. The
answers given were pointless, and often not free
from grammatical mistakes; the stout general
related that he had once in answer to the question:
<i>Qu’est-ce que l’amour?</i> replied, <i>Une colique
remontée au cœur</i>, and promptly went off into
his wooden guffaw; the ancient ruin with a
mighty effort struck him with her fan on the
arm; a flake of plaster was shaken off her forehead
by this rash action. The old crone was
beginning a reference to the Slavonic principalities
and the necessity of orthodox propaganda
on the Danube, but, meeting with no response,
she subsided with a hiss. In reality they talked
more about Home than anything else; even
the ‘Queen of the Wasps’ described how hands
had once crept about her, and how she had seen
them, and put her own ring on one of them.
It was certainly a triumph for Irina: even if
Litvinov had paid more attention to what was
being said around him, he still could not have
gleaned one single sincere saying, one single
clever thought, one single new fact from all
their disconnected and lifeless babble. Even
in their cries and exclamations, there was no
note of real feeling, in their slander no real heat.
Only at rare intervals under the mask of assumed
patriotic indignation, or of assumed contempt
and indifference, the dread of possible losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">-179-</a></span>
could be heard in a plaintive whimper, and a
few names, which will not be forgotten by
posterity, were pronounced with gnashing of
teeth ... And not a drop of living water under
all this noise and wrangle! What stale, what
unprofitable nonsense, what wretched trivialities
were absorbing all these heads and hearts, and
not for that one evening, not in society only,
but at home too, every hour and every day, in
all the depth and breadth of their existence!
And what ignorance, when all is said! What
lack of understanding of all on which human
life is built, all by which life is made beautiful!</p>

<p>On parting from Litvinov, Irina again pressed
his hand and whispered significantly, ‘Well?
Are you pleased? Have you seen enough?
Do you like it?’ He made her no reply, but
merely bowed low in silence.</p>

<p>Left alone with her husband, Irina was just
going to her bedroom.... He stopped her.</p>

<p>‘<i>Je vous ai beaucoup admirée ce soir, madame</i>,’
he observed, smoking a cigarette, and leaning
against the mantelpiece, ‘<i>vous vous êtes parfaitement
moquée de nous tous</i>.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Pas plus cette fois-ci que les autres</i>,’ she
answered indifferently.</p>

<p>‘How do you mean me to understand you?’
asked Ratmirov.</p>

<p>‘As you like.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">-180-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Hm. <i>C’est clair.</i>’ Ratmirov warily, like a cat,
knocked off the ash of the cigarette with the
tip of the long nail of his little finger. ‘Oh, by
the way! This new friend of yours&mdash;what the
dickens is his name?&mdash;Mr. Litvinov&mdash;doubtless
enjoys the reputation of a very clever man.’</p>

<p>At the name of Litvinov, Irina turned
quickly round.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean to say?’</p>

<p>The general smiled.</p>

<p>‘He keeps very quiet ... one can see he’s
afraid of compromising himself.’</p>

<p>Irina too smiled; it was a very different smile
from her husband’s.</p>

<p>‘Better keep quiet than talk ... as some
people talk.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Attrapé!</i>’ answered Ratmirov with feigned
submissiveness. ‘Joking apart, he has a very
interesting face. Such a ... concentrated
expression ... and his whole bearing....
Yes....’ The general straightened his cravat,
and bending his head stared at his own moustache.
‘He’s a republican, I imagine, of the same
sort as your other friend, Mr. Potugin; that’s
another of your clever fellows who are dumb.’</p>

<p>Irina’s brows were slowly raised above her
wide open clear eyes, while her lips were
tightly pressed together and faintly curved.</p>

<p>‘What’s your object in saying that, Valerian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-181-</a></span>
Vladimiritch,’ she remarked, as though sympathetically.
‘You are wasting your arrows on the
empty air.... We are not in Russia, and
there is no one to hear you.’</p>

<p>Ratmirov was stung.</p>

<p>‘That’s not merely my opinion, Irina Pavlovna,’
he began in a voice suddenly guttural;
‘other people too notice that that gentleman
has the air of a conspirator.’</p>

<p>‘Really? who are these other people?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Boris for instance&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘What? was it necessary for him too to express
his opinion?’</p>

<p>Irina shrugged her shoulders as though
shrinking from the cold, and slowly passed the
tips of her fingers over them.</p>

<p>‘Him ... yes, him. Allow me to remark,
Irina Pavlovna, that you seem angry; and you
know if one is angry&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Am I angry? Oh, what for?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know; possibly you have been disagreeably
affected by the observation I permitted
myself to make in reference to&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Ratmirov stammered.</p>

<p>‘In reference to?’ Irina repeated interrogatively.
‘Ah, if you please, no irony, and make
haste. I’m tired and sleepy.’</p>

<p>She took a candle from the table. ‘In
reference to&mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-182-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, in reference to this same Mr. Litvinov;
since there’s no doubt now that you take a
great interest in him.’</p>

<p>Irina lifted the hand in which she was holding
the candlestick, till the flame was brought on
a level with her husband’s face, and attentively,
almost with curiosity, looking him straight in
the face, she suddenly burst into laughter.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ asked Ratmirov scowling.</p>

<p>Irina went on laughing.</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it?’ he repeated, and he
stamped his foot.</p>

<p>He felt insulted, wounded, and at the same
time against his will he was impressed by the
beauty of this woman, standing so lightly and
boldly before him ... she was tormenting him.
He saw everything, all her charms&mdash;even the
pink reflection of the delicate nails on her
slender finger-tips, as they tightly clasped the
dark bronze of the heavy candlestick&mdash;even
that did not escape him ... while the insult
cut deeper and deeper into his heart. And still
Irina laughed.</p>

<p>‘What? you? you jealous?’ she brought out
at last, and turning her back on her husband
she went out of the room. ‘He’s jealous!’
he heard outside the door, and again came the
sound of her laugh.</p>

<p>Ratmirov looked moodily after his wife; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-183-</a></span>
could not even then help noticing the bewitching
grace of her figure, her movements, and
with a violent blow, crushing the cigarette on
the marble slab of the mantelpiece, he flung it
to a distance. His cheeks had suddenly turned
white, a spasm passed over the lower half of his
face, and with a dull animal stare his eyes
strayed about the floor, as though in search of
something.... Every semblance of refinement
had vanished from his face. Such an expression
it must have worn when he was flogging
the White Russian peasants.</p>

<p>Litvinov had gone home to his rooms, and
sitting down to the table he had buried his
head in both hands, and remained a long while
without stirring. He got up at last, opened a
box, and taking out a pocket-book, he drew
out of an inner pocket a photograph of Tatyana.
Her face gazed out mournfully at him, looking
ugly and old, as photographs usually do.
Litvinov’s betrothed was a girl of Great
Russian blood, a blonde, rather plump, and
with the features of her face rather heavy, but
with a wonderful expression of kindness and
goodness in her intelligent, clear brown eyes,
with a serene, white brow, on which it seemed
as though a sunbeam always rested. For a
long time Litvinov did not take his eyes from
the photograph, then he pushed it gently away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-184-</a></span>
and again clutched his head in both hands.
‘All is at an end!’ he whispered at last, ‘Irina!
Irina!’</p>

<p>Only now, only at that instant, he realised that
he was irrevocably, senselessly, in love with her,
that he had loved her since the very day of
that first meeting with her at the Old Castle,
that he had never ceased to love her. And yet
how astounded, how incredulous, how scornful,
he would have been, had he been told so a few
hours back!</p>

<p>‘But Tanya, Tanya, my God! Tanya! Tanya!’
he repeated in contrition; while Irina’s shape
fairly rose before his eyes in her black almost
funereal garb, with the radiant calm of victory
on her marble white face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-185-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov did not sleep all night, and did not
undress. He was very miserable. As an
honest and straightforward man, he realised
the force of obligations, the sacredness of duty,
and would have been ashamed of any double
dealing with himself, his weakness, his fault.
At first he was overcome by apathy; it was long
before he could throw off the gloomy burden of
a single half-conscious, obscure sensation; then
terror took possession of him at the thought
that the future, his almost conquered future, had
slipped back into the darkness, that his home,
the solidly-built home he had only just raised,
was suddenly tottering about him....</p>

<p>He began reproaching himself without mercy,
but at once checked his own vehemence.
‘What feebleness!’ he thought. ‘It’s no time
for self-reproach and cowardice; now I must act.
Tanya is my betrothed, she has faith in my love,
my honour, we are bound together for life, and
cannot, must not, be put asunder.’ He vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-186-</a></span>
pictured to himself all Tanya’s qualities, mentally
he picked them out and reckoned them
up; he was trying to call up feeling and tenderness
in himself. ‘One thing’s left for me,’ he
thought again, ‘to run away, to run away
directly, without waiting for her arrival, to
hasten to meet her; whether I suffer, whether
I am wretched with Tanya&mdash;that’s not likely&mdash;but
in any case to think of that, to take that
into consideration is useless; I must do my
duty, if I die for it! But you have no right to
deceive her,’ whispered another voice within him.
‘You have no right to hide from her the change
in your feelings; it may be that when she
knows you love another woman, she will not be
willing to become your wife? Rubbish! rubbish!’
he answered, ‘that’s all sophistry,
shameful double-dealing, deceitful conscientiousness;
I have no right not to keep my word,
that’s the thing. Well, so be it.... Then I must
go away from here, without seeing the other....’</p>

<p>But at that point Litvinov’s heart throbbed
with anguish, he turned cold, physically cold, a
momentary shiver passed over him, his teeth
chattered weakly. He stretched and yawned,
as though he were in a fever. Without dwelling
longer on his last thought, choking back
that thought, turning away from it, he set
himself to marvelling and wondering in perplexity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-187-</a></span>
how he could again ... again love
that corrupt worldly creature, all of whose
surroundings were so hateful, so repulsive to
him. He tried to put to himself the question:
‘What nonsense, do you really love her?’ and
could only wring his hands in despair. He was
still marvelling and wondering, and suddenly
there rose up before his eyes, as though from
a soft fragrant mist, a seductive shape, shining
eyelashes were lifted, and softly and irresistibly
the marvellous eyes pierced him to the
heart and a voice was singing with sweetness
in his ears, and resplendent shoulders, the
shoulders of a young queen, were breathing
with voluptuous freshness and warmth....</p>


<p class="tb">Towards morning a determination was at
last fully formed in Litvinov’s mind. He
decided to set off that day to meet Tatyana, and
seeing Irina for the last time, to tell her, since
there was nothing else for it, the whole truth,
and to part from her for ever.</p>

<p>He set in order and packed his things, waited
till twelve o’clock, and started to go to her.
But at the sight of her half-curtained windows
Litvinov’s heart fairly failed him ... he could
not summon up courage to enter the hotel. He
walked once or twice up and down Lichtenthaler
Allee. ‘A very good day to Mr. Litvinov!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-188-</a></span>’
he suddenly heard an ironical voice call from
the top of a swiftly-moving ‘dogcart.’ Litvinov
raised his eyes and saw General Ratmirov
sitting beside Prince M., a well-known sportsman
and fancier of English carriages and
horses. The prince was driving, the general
was leaning over on one side, grinning, while
he lifted his hat high above his head. Litvinov
bowed to him, and at the same instant,
as though he were obeying a secret command,
he set off at a run towards Irina’s.</p>

<p>She was at home. He sent up his name; he
was at once received. When he went in, she
was standing in the middle of the room. She
was wearing a morning blouse with wide open
sleeves; her face, pale as the day before, but
not fresh as it had been then, expressed weariness;
the languid smile with which she welcomed
her visitor emphasised that expression even
more clearly. She held out her hand to him in
a friendly way, but absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>‘Thanks for coming,’ she began in a plaintive
voice, and she sank into a low chair. ‘I am
not very well this morning; I spent a bad
night. Well, what have you to say about last
night? Wasn’t I right?’</p>

<p>Litvinov sat down.</p>

<p>‘I have come to you, Irina Pavlovna,’ he
began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-189-</a></span></p>

<p>She instantly sat up and turned round; her
eyes simply fastened upon Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘What is it,’ she cried. ‘You’re pale as death,
you’re ill. What’s the matter with you?’</p>

<p>Litvinov was confused.</p>

<p>‘With me, Irina Pavlovna?’</p>

<p>‘Have you had bad news? Some misfortune
has happened, tell me, tell me&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Litvinov in his turn looked at Irina.</p>

<p>‘I have had no bad news,’ he brought out
not without effort, ‘but a misfortune has certainly
happened, a great misfortune ... and it has
brought me to you.’</p>

<p>‘A misfortune? What is it?’</p>

<p>‘Why ... that&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Litvinov tried to go on ... and could not.
He only pinched his hands together so that
his fingers cracked. Irina was bending forward
and seemed turned to stone.</p>

<p>‘Oh! I love you!’ broke at last with a low
groan from Litvinov’s breast, and he turned
away, as though he would hide his face.</p>

<p>‘What, Grigory Mihalitch, you’ ... Irina
too could not finish her sentence, and leaning
back in her chair, she put both her hands to her
eyes. ‘You ... love me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes ... yes ... yes,’ he repeated with
bitterness, turning his head further and further
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-190-</a></span></p>

<p>Everything was silent in the room; a butterfly
that had flown in was fluttering its wings
and struggling between the curtain and the
window.</p>

<p>The first to speak was Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘That, Irina Pavlovna,’ he began, ‘that is the
misfortune, which ... has befallen me, which
I ought to have foreseen and avoided, if I had
not now just as in the Moscow days been
carried off my feet at once. It seems fate is
pleased to force me once again through you
to suffer tortures, which one would have thought
should not be repeated again.... It was
not without cause I struggled.... I tried to
struggle; but of course there’s no escaping
one’s fate. And I tell you all this to put an
end at once to this ... this tragic farce,’ he
added with a fresh outburst of shame and
bitterness.</p>

<p>Litvinov was silent again; the butterfly was
struggling and fluttering as before. Irina did not
take her hands from her face.</p>

<p>‘And you are not mistaken?’ her whisper
sounded from under those white, bloodless-looking
hands.</p>

<p>‘I am not mistaken,’ answered Litvinov in a
colourless voice. ‘I love you, as I have never
loved any one but you. I am not going to
reproach you; that would be too foolish; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-191-</a></span>’m
not going to tell you that perhaps nothing of
all this would have happened if you yourself
had behaved differently with me.... Of course,
I alone am to blame, my self-confidence has
been my ruin; I am deservedly punished, and
you could not have anticipated it. Of course
you did not consider that it would have been
far less dangerous for me if you had not been
so keenly alive to your wrong ... your supposed
wrong to me; and had not wished to
make up for it ... but what’s done can’t be
undone. I only wanted to make clear my
position to you; it’s hard enough as it is....
But at least there will be, as you say, no misunderstanding,
while the openness of my confession
will soften, I hope, the feeling of offence
which you cannot but feel.’</p>

<p>Litvinov spoke without raising his eyes, but
even if he had glanced at Irina, he could not
have seen what was passing in her face, as she
still as before kept her hands over her eyes.
But what was passing over her face meanwhile
would probably have astounded him; both
alarm and delight were apparent on it, and a
kind of blissful helplessness and agitation; her
eyes hardly glimmered under their overhanging
lids, and her slow, broken breathing was chill
upon her lips, that were parted as though with
thirst....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-192-</a></span></p>

<p>Litvinov was silent, waiting for a response,
some sound.... Nothing!</p>

<p>‘There is one thing left for me,’ he began
again, ‘to go away; I have come to say good-bye
to you.’</p>

<p>Irina slowly dropped her hands on to her
knees.</p>

<p>‘But I remember, Grigory Mihalitch,’ she
began; ‘that ... that person of whom you
spoke to me, she was to have come here? You
are expecting her?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but I shall write to her ... she will
stop somewhere on the way ... at Heidelberg,
for instance.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Heidelberg.... Yes.... It’s nice
there.... But all this must upset your plans.
Are you perfectly certain, Grigory Mihalitch,
that you are not exaggerating, <i>et que ce n’est
pas une fausse alarme?</i>’</p>

<p>Irina spoke softly, almost coldly, with short
pauses, looking away towards the window.
Litvinov made no answer to her last question.</p>

<p>‘Only, why did you talk of offence?’ she went
on. ‘I am not offended ... oh, no! and if one
or other of us is to blame, in any case it’s not
you; not you alone.... Remember our last
conversations, and you will be convinced that
it’s not you who are to blame.’</p>

<p>‘I have never doubted your magnanimity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">-193-</a></span>’
Litvinov muttered between his teeth, ‘but I
should like to know, do you approve of my
intention?’</p>

<p>‘To go away?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Irina continued to look away.</p>

<p>‘At the first moment, your intention struck
me as premature ... but now I have thought
over what you have said ... and if you are
really not mistaken, then I suppose that you
ought to go away. It will be better so ...
better for us both.’</p>

<p>Irina’s voice had grown lower and lower, and
her words too came more and more slowly.</p>

<p>‘General Ratmirov, certainly, might notice,’
Litvinov was beginning....</p>

<p>Irina’s eyes dropped again, and something
strange quivered about her lips, quivered and
died away.</p>

<p>‘No; you did not understand me,’ she interrupted
him. ‘I was not thinking of my husband.
Why should I? And there is nothing to notice.
But I repeat, separation is necessary for us
both.’</p>

<p>Litvinov picked up his hat, which had fallen
on the ground.</p>

<p>‘Everything is over,’ he thought, ‘I must go.
And so it only remains for me to say good-bye
to you, Irina Pavlovna,’ he said aloud, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-194-</a></span>
suddenly felt a pang, as though he were preparing
to pronounce his own sentence on himself.
‘It only remains for me to hope that you
will not remember evil against me, and ... and
that if we ever&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Irina again cut him short.</p>

<p>‘Wait a little, Grigory Mihalitch, don’t say
good-bye to me yet. That would be too
hurried.’</p>

<p>Something wavered in Litvinov, but the
burning pain broke out again and with redoubled
violence in his heart.</p>

<p>‘But I can’t stay,’ he cried. ‘What for?
Why prolong this torture?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say good-bye to me yet,’ repeated
Irina. ‘I must see you once more.... Another
such dumb parting as in Moscow again&mdash;no,
I don’t want that. You can go now, but
you must promise me, give me your word of
honour that you won’t go away without seeing
me once more.’</p>

<p>‘You wish that?’</p>

<p>‘I insist on it. If you go away without saying
good-bye to me, I shall never forgive it, do
you hear, never! Strange!’ she added as
though to herself, ‘I cannot persuade myself
that I am in Baden.... I keep feeling that I
am in Moscow.... Go now.’</p>

<p>Litvinov got up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-195-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Irina Pavlovna,’ he said, ‘give me your hand.’</p>

<p>Irina shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I told you that I don’t want to say good-bye
to you....’</p>

<p>‘I don’t ask it for that.’</p>

<p>Irina was about to stretch out her hand, but
she glanced at Litvinov for the first time since
his avowal, and drew it back.</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ she whispered, ‘I will not give you
my hand. No ... no. Go now.’</p>

<p>Litvinov bowed and went away. He could
not tell why Irina had refused him that last
friendly handshake.... He could not know
what she feared.</p>

<p>He went away, and Irina again sank into the
armchair and again covered her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-196-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov did not return home; he went up
to the hills, and getting into a thick copse, he
flung himself face downwards on the earth, and
lay there about an hour. He did not suffer
tortures, did not weep; he sank into a kind of
heavy, oppressive stupor. Never had he felt
anything like it; it was an insufferably aching
and gnawing sensation of emptiness, emptiness
in himself, his surroundings, everywhere....
He thought neither of Irina nor of Tatyana.
He felt one thing only: a blow had fallen and
life was sundered like a cord, and all of him
was being drawn along in the clutches of something
chill and unfamiliar. Sometimes it seemed
to him that a whirlwind had swooped down
upon him, and he had the sensation of its swift
whirling round and the irregular beating of its
dark wings. But his resolution did not waver.
To remain in Baden ... that could not even
be considered. In thought he had already gone,
he was already sitting in the rattling, snorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">-197-</a></span>
train, hurrying, hurrying into the dumb, dead
distance. He got up at last, and leaning his
head against a tree, stayed motionless; only
with one hand, he all unconsciously snatched
and swung in rhythm the topmost frond of a
fern. The sound of approaching footsteps drew
him out of his stupor: two charcoal-burners
were making their way down the steep path
with large sacks on their shoulders. ‘It’s
time!’ whispered Litvinov, and he followed the
charcoal-burners to the town, turned into the
railway station, and sent off a telegram to
Tatyana’s aunt, Kapitolina Markovna. In this
telegram he informed her of his immediate
departure, and appointed as a meeting-place,
Schrader’s hotel in Heidelberg.</p>

<p>‘Make an end, make an end at once,’ he
thought; ‘it’s useless putting it off till to-morrow.’
Then he went to the gambling
saloon, stared with dull curiosity at the faces
of two or three gamblers, got a back view of
Bindasov’s ugly head in the distance, noticed
the irreproachable countenance of Pishtchalkin,
and after waiting a little under the colonnade,
he set off deliberately to Irina’s. He was not
going to her through the force of sudden, involuntary
temptation; when he made up his
mind to go away, he also made up his mind
to keep his word and see her once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-198-</a></span>
He went into the hotel unobserved by the
porter, ascended the staircase, not meeting any
one, and without knocking at the door, he
mechanically pushed it open and went into
the room.</p>

<p>In the room, in the same armchair, in the
same dress, in precisely the same attitude as
three hours before, was sitting Irina.... It
was obvious that she had not moved from the
place, had not stirred all that time. She slowly
raised her head, and seeing Litvinov, she
trembled all over and clutched the arm of the
chair. ‘You frightened me,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>Litvinov looked at her with speechless bewilderment.
The expression of her face, her
lustreless eyes, astounded him.</p>

<p>Irina gave a forced smile and smoothed her
ruffled hair. ‘Never mind.... I really don’t
know.... I think I must have fallen asleep
here.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, Irina Pavlovna,’ began
Litvinov. ‘I came in unannounced.... I
wanted to do what you thought fit to require of
me. So as I am going away to-day&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘To-day? But I thought you told me that
you meant first to write a letter&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I have sent a telegram.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you found it necessary to make haste.
And when are you going? What time, I mean?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">-199-</a></span></p>

<p>‘At seven o’clock this evening.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! at seven o’clock! And you have come
to say good-bye?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Irina Pavlovna, to say good-bye.’</p>

<p>Irina was silent for a little.</p>

<p>‘I ought to thank you, Grigory Mihalitch, it
was probably not easy for you to come here.’</p>

<p>‘No, Irina Pavlovna, it was anything but
easy.’</p>

<p>‘Life is not generally easy, Grigory Mihalitch;
what do you think about it?’</p>

<p>‘It depends, Irina Pavlovna.’</p>

<p>Irina was silent again for a little; she seemed
sunk in thought.</p>

<p>‘You have proved your affection for me by
coming,’ she said at last, ‘I thank you. And I
fully approve of your decision to put an end to
everything as soon as possible ... because any
delay ... because ... because I, even I whom
you have reproached as a flirt, called an actress
... that, I think, was what you called me?...’</p>

<p>Irina got up swiftly, and, sitting down in
another chair, stooped down and pressed her
face and arms on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>‘Because I love you ...’ she whispered between
her clasped fingers.</p>

<p>Litvinov staggered, as though some one had
dealt him a blow in the chest. Irina turned her
head dejectedly away from him, as though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">-200-</a></span>
in her turn wanted to hide her face from him,
and laid it down on the table.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I love you ... I love you ... and you
know it.’</p>

<p>‘I? I know it?’ Litvinov said at last; ‘I?’</p>

<p>‘Well, now you see,’ Irina went on, ‘that you
certainly must go, that delay’s impossible ...
both for you, and for me delay’s impossible.
It’s dangerous, it’s terrible ... good-bye!’
she added, rising impulsively from her chair,
‘good-bye!’</p>

<p>She took a few steps in the direction of the
door of her boudoir, and putting her hand behind
her back, made a hurried movement in the
air, as though she would find and press the hand
of Litvinov; but he stood like a block of wood,
at a distance.... Once more she said, ‘Good-bye,
forget me,’ and without looking round she
rushed away.</p>

<p>Litvinov remained alone, and yet still could
not come to himself. He recovered himself at
last, went quickly to the boudoir door, uttered
Irina’s name once, twice, three times.... He
had already his hand on the lock.... From
the hotel stairs rose the sound of Ratmirov’s
sonorous voice.</p>

<p>Litvinov pulled down his hat over his eyes,
and went out on to the staircase. The elegant
general was standing before the Swiss porter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">-201-</a></span>’s
box and explaining to him in bad German that
he wanted a hired carriage for the whole of the
next day. On catching sight of Litvinov, he
again lifted his hat unnaturally high, and again
wished him ‘a very good-day’; he was obviously
jeering at him, but Litvinov had no thoughts for
that. He hardly responded to Ratmirov’s bow,
and, making his way to his lodging, he stood
still before his already packed and closed trunk.
His head was turning round and his heart
vibrating like a harp-string. What was to be
done now? And could he have foreseen this?</p>

<p>Yes, he had foreseen it, however unlikely it
seemed. It had stunned him like a clap of
thunder, yet he had foreseen it, though he had
not courage even to acknowledge it. Besides he
knew nothing now for certain. Everything was
confusion and turmoil within him; he had lost
the thread of his own thoughts. He remembered
Moscow, he remembered how then too
‘it’ had come upon him like a sudden
tempest. He was breathless; rapture, but a
rapture comfortless and hopeless, oppressed and
tore his heart. For nothing in the world would
he have consented that the words uttered by
Irina should not have actually been uttered by
her.... But then? those words could not for
all that change the resolution he had taken.
As before, it did not waver; it stood firm like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">-202-</a></span>
an anchor. Litvinov had lost the thread of his
own thoughts ... yes; but his will still remained
to him, and he disposed of himself as of
another man dependent on him. He rang for
the waiter, asked him for the bill, bespoke a
place in the evening omnibus; designedly he
cut himself off all paths of retreat. ‘If I die for
it after!’ he declared, as he had in the previous
sleepless night; that phrase seemed especially
to his taste. ‘Then even if I die for it!’ he repeated,
walking slowly up and down the room,
and only at rare intervals, unconsciously, he
shut his eyes and held his breath, while those
words, those words of Irina’s forced their way
into his soul, and set it aflame. ‘It seems you
won’t love twice,’ he thought; ‘another life
came to you, you let it come into yours&mdash;never to
be rid of that poison to the end, you will never
break those bonds! Yes; but what does that
prove? Happiness?... Is it possible? You
love her, granted ... and she ... she loves
you....’</p>

<p>But at this point again he had to pull himself
up. As a traveller on a dark night, seeing before
him a light, and afraid of losing the path, never
for an instant takes his eyes off it, so Litvinov
continually bent all the force of his attention on
a single point, a single aim. To reach his betrothed,
and not precisely even his betrothed (he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">-203-</a></span>
was trying not to think of her) but to reach
a room in the Heidelberg hotel, that was what
stood immovably before him, a guiding light.
What would be later, he did not know, nor did
he want to know.... One thing was beyond
doubt, he would not come back. ‘If I die
first!’ he repeated for the tenth time, and he
glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>A quarter-past six! How long still to wait!
He paced once more up and down. The sun
was nearly setting, the sky was crimson above
the trees, and the pink flush of twilight lay on
the narrow windows of his darkening room.
Suddenly Litvinov fancied the door had been
opened quickly and softly behind him and as
quickly closed again.... He turned round; at
the door, muffled in a dark cloak, was standing
a woman....</p>

<p>‘Irina,’ he cried, and clapped his hands together
in amazement.... She raised her head
and fell upon his breast.</p>

<p>Two hours later he was sitting in his room on
the sofa. His box stood in the corner, open
and empty, and on the table in the midst of
things flung about in disorder, lay a letter from
Tatyana, just received by him. She wrote to
him that she had decided to hasten her departure
from Dresden, since her aunt’s health was completely
restored, and that if nothing happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-204-</a></span>
to delay them, they would both be in Baden the
following day at twelve o’clock, and hoped that
he would come to meet them at the station.
Apartments had already been taken for them
by Litvinov in the same hotel in which he was
staying.</p>

<p>The same evening he sent a note to Irina, and
the following morning he received a reply from
her. ‘Sooner or later,’ she wrote, ‘it must have
been. I tell you again what I said yesterday:
my life is in your hands, do with me what you
will. I do not want to hamper your freedom,
but let me say, that if necessary, I will throw
up everything, and follow you to the ends of
the earth. We shall see each other to-morrow,
of course.&mdash;Your Irina.’</p>

<p>The last two words were written in a large,
bold, resolute hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-205-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII</a></h2>


<p>Among the persons assembled on the 18th of
August at twelve o’clock on the platform at
the railway station was Litvinov. Not long
before, he had seen Irina: she was sitting in an
open carriage with her husband and another
gentleman, somewhat elderly. She caught
sight of Litvinov, and he perceived that some
obscure emotion flitted over her eyes; but at
once she hid herself from him with her parasol.</p>

<p>A strange transformation had taken place in
him since the previous day&mdash;in his whole
appearance, his movements, the expression of
his face; and indeed he felt himself a different
man. His self-confidence had vanished, and
his peace of mind had vanished too, and his
respect for himself; of his former spiritual condition
nothing was left. Recent ineffaceable
impressions obscured all the rest from him.
Some sensation unknown before had come,
strong, sweet&mdash;and evil; the mysterious guest
had made its way to the innermost shrine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-206-</a></span>
taken possession and lain down in it, in silence,
but in all its magnitude, like the owner in a
new house. Litvinov was no longer ashamed,
he was afraid; at the same time a desperate
hardihood had sprung up in him; the captured,
the vanquished know well this mixture of opposing
feelings; the thief too knows something of
it after his first robbery. Litvinov had been
vanquished, vanquished suddenly ... and what
had become of his honesty?</p>

<p>The train was a few minutes late. Litvinov’s
suspense passed into agonising torture; he could
not stop still in one place, and, pale all over,
moved about jostling in the crowd. ‘My God,’
he thought, ‘if I only had another twenty-four
hours.’... The first look at Tanya, the first look
of Tanya ... that was what filled him with
terror ... that was what he had to live through
directly.... And afterwards? Afterwards ...
come, what may come!... He now made no
more resolutions, he could not answer for himself
now. His phrase of yesterday flashed painfully
through his head.... And this was how
he was meeting Tanya....</p>

<p>A prolonged whistle sounded at last, a heavy
momentarily increasing rumble was heard, and,
slowly rolling round a bend in the line, the
train came into sight. The crowd hurried to
meet it, and Litvinov followed it, dragging his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-207-</a></span>
feet like a condemned man. Faces, ladies’ hats
began to appear out of the carriages, at one
window a white handkerchief gleamed....
Kapitolina Markovna was waving to him....
It was over; she had caught sight of Litvinov
and he recognised her. The train stood still;
Litvinov rushed to the carriage door, and
opened it; Tatyana was standing near her aunt,
smiling brightly and holding out her hand.</p>

<p>He helped them both to get out, uttered a
few words of welcome, unfinished and confused,
and at once bustled about, began taking their
tickets, their travelling bags, and rugs, ran to
find a porter, called a fly; other people were
bustling around them. He was glad of their
presence, their fuss, and loud talk. Tatyana
moved a little aside, and, still smiling, waited
calmly for his hurried arrangements to be concluded.
Kapitolina Markovna, on the other
hand, could not keep still; she could not believe
that she was at last at Baden.</p>

<p>She suddenly cried, ‘But the parasols?
Tanya, where are our parasols?’ all unconscious
that she was holding them fast under her arm;
then she began taking a loud and prolonged
farewell of another lady with whom she had
made friends on the journey from Heidelberg
to Baden. This lady was no other than our
old friend Madame Suhantchikov. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-208-</a></span>
gone away to Heidelberg to do obeisance to
Gubaryov, and was returning with ‘instructions.’
Kapitolina Markovna wore a rather peculiar
striped mantle and a round travelling hat of a
mushroom-shape, from under which her short
white hair fell in disorder; short and thin, she
was flushed with travelling and kept talking
Russian in a shrill and penetrating voice....
She was an object of attention at once.</p>

<p>Litvinov at last put her and Tatyana into a
fly, and placed himself opposite them. The
horses started. Then followed questionings,
renewed handshaking, interchanging of smiles
and welcomes.... Litvinov breathed freely;
the first moment had passed off satisfactorily.
Nothing in him, apparently, had struck or
bewildered Tanya; she was smiling just as
brightly and confidently, she was blushing as
charmingly, and laughing as goodnaturedly.
He brought himself at last to take a look at her;
not a stealthy cursory glance, but a direct steady
look at her, hitherto his own eyes had refused to
obey him. His heart throbbed with involuntary
emotion: the serene expression of that honest,
candid face gave him a pang of bitter reproach.
‘So you are here, poor girl,’ he thought, ‘you
whom I have so longed for, so urged to come,
with whom I had hoped to spend my life to the
end, you have come, you believed in me ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">-209-</a></span>
while I ... while I.’... Litvinov’s head sank;
but Kapitolina Markovna gave him no time for
musing; she was pelting him with questions.</p>

<p>‘What is that building with columns? Where
is it the gambling’s done? Who is that
coming along? Tanya, Tanya, look, what crinolines!
And who can that be? I suppose they
are mostly French creatures from Paris here?
Mercy, what a hat! Can you get everything
here just as in Paris? But, I expect, everything’s
awfully dear, eh? Ah, I’ve made the
acquaintance of such a splendid, intellectual
woman! You know her, Grigory Mihalitch;
she told me she had met you at some
Russian’s, who’s a wonderfully intellectual person
too. She promised to come and see us.
How she does abuse all these aristocrats&mdash;it’s
simply superb! What is that gentleman with
grey moustaches? The Prussian king? Tanya,
Tanya, look, that’s the Prussian king. No?
not the Prussian king, the Dutch ambassador,
did you say? I can’t hear, the wheels
rattle so. Ah, what exquisite trees!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, exquisite, aunt,’ Tanya assented, ‘and
how green everything is here, how bright and
gay! Isn’t it, Grigory Mihalitch?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very bright and gay’ ... he answered
through his teeth.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped at last before the hotel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">-210-</a></span>
Litvinov conducted the two travellers to the
room taken for them, promised to come back
within an hour, and went to his own room.
Directly he entered it, he fell again under the
spell which had been lulled for a while. Here,
in that room, since the day before, Irina reigned
supreme; everything was eloquent of her, the
very air seemed to have kept secret traces of
her visit.... Again Litvinov felt himself her
slave. He drew out her handkerchief, hidden
in his bosom, pressed it to his lips, and burning
memories flowed in subtle poison through his
veins. He realised that there was no turning
back, no choosing now; the sorrowful emotion
aroused in him by Tatyana melted away like
snow in the fire, and remorse died down ...
died down so completely that his uneasiness
even was soothed, and the possibility&mdash;present
to his intellect&mdash;of hypocrisy no longer revolted
him.... Love, Irina’s love, that was now his
truth, his bond, his conscience.... The sensible
Litvinov did not even ponder how to get
out of a position, the horror and hideousness of
which he bore lightly, as if it did not concern
him.</p>

<p>The hour had not yet passed when a waiter
came to Litvinov from the newly arrived ladies;
they begged him to come to them in the public
drawing-room. He followed the messenger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">-211-</a></span>
and found them already dressed and in their
hats. They both expressed a desire to go out
at once to see Baden, as the weather was so fine.
Kapitolina Markovna especially seemed burning
with impatience; she was quite cast down when
she heard that the hour of the fashionable promenade
before the Konversation Hall had not
yet arrived. Litvinov gave her his arm, and the
ceremony of sight-seeing began. Tatyana walked
beside her aunt, looking about her with quiet
interest; Kapitolina Markovna pursued her inquiries.
The sight of the roulette, the dignified
croupiers, whom&mdash;had she met them in any
other place&mdash;she would certainly have taken for
ministers, the quickly moving scoops, the heaps
of gold and silver on the green cloth, the old
women gambling, and the painted <i>cocottes</i>
reduced Kapitolina Markovna to a sort of
speechless stupor; she altogether forgot that
she ought to feel moral indignation, and could
only gaze and gaze, giving a start of surprise at
every new sight.... The whiz of the ivory
ball into the bottom of the roulette thrilled her
to the marrow of her bones, and it was only
when she was again in the open air that, drawing
a long breath, she recovered energy enough
to denounce games of chance as an immoral
invention of aristocracy. A fixed, unpleasant
smile had made its appearance on Litvinov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">-212-</a></span>’s
lips; he had spoken abruptly and lazily, as
though he were annoyed or bored.... But now
he turned round towards Tatyana, and was
thrown into secret confusion; she was looking
attentively at him, with an expression as though
she were asking herself what sort of an impression
was being made on her. He made haste
to nod his head to her, she responded with the
same gesture, and again looked at him questioningly,
with a sort of strained effort, as though
he were standing much further off than he
really was. Litvinov led his ladies away from
the Konversation Hall, and passing the ‘Russian
tree,’ under which two Russian ladies
were already sitting, he went towards Lichtenthaler
Allee. He had hardly entered the avenue
when he saw Irina in the distance.</p>

<p>She was walking towards him with her husband
and Potugin. Litvinov turned white as a
sheet; he did not slacken his pace, however,
and when he was on a level with her, he made
a bow without speaking. She too bowed to
him, politely, but coldly, and taking in Tatyana
in a rapid glance, she glided by.... Ratmirov
lifted his hat high, Potugin muttered something.</p>

<p>‘Who is that lady?’ Tatyana asked suddenly.
Till that instant she had hardly opened her lips.</p>

<p>‘That lady?’ repeated Litvinov, ‘that lady?
That is a Madame Ratmirov.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">-213-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Is she Russian?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Did you make her acquaintance here?’</p>

<p>‘No; I have known her a long while.’</p>

<p>‘How beautiful she is!’</p>

<p>‘Did you notice her dress?’ put in Kapitolina
Markovna. ‘Ten families might live for a
whole year on the cost of her lace alone. Was
that her husband with her?’ she inquired
turning to Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘He must be awfully rich, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Really I don’t know; I don’t think so.’</p>

<p>‘What is his rank?’</p>

<p>‘He’s a general.’</p>

<p>‘What eyes she has!’ said Tatyana, ‘and
what a strange expression in them: pensive
and penetrating at the same time.... I have
never seen such eyes.’</p>

<p>Litvinov made no answer; he fancied that he
felt again Tatyana’s questioning glance bent on
his face, but he was wrong, she was looking at
her own feet, at the sand of the path.</p>

<p>‘Mercy on us! Who is that fright?’ cried
Kapitolina Markovna suddenly, pointing to a
low jaunting-car in which a red-haired pug-nosed
woman lay lolling impudently, in an
extraordinarily gorgeous costume and lilac
stockings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">-214-</a></span></p>

<p>‘That fright! why, that’s the celebrated
Ma’mselle Cora.’</p>

<p>‘Who?’</p>

<p>‘Ma’mselle Cora ... a Parisian ... notoriety.’</p>

<p>‘What? That pug? Why, but she’s hideous!’</p>

<p>‘It seems that’s no hindrance.’</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna could only lift her
hands in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Well, this Baden of yours!’ she brought out
at last. ‘Can one sit down on a seat here?
I’m rather tired.’</p>

<p>‘Of course you can, Kapitolina Markovna....
That’s what the seats are put here for.’</p>

<p>‘Well, really, there’s no knowing! But there
in Paris, I’m told, there are seats, too, along
the boulevards; but it’s not proper to sit on
them.’</p>

<p>Litvinov made no reply to Kapitolina Markovna;
only at that moment he realised that
two paces away was the very spot where he had
had that explanation with Irina, which had
decided everything. Then he recalled that he
had noticed a small rosy spot on her cheek
to-day....</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna sank down on to the
seat, Tatyana sat down beside her. Litvinov
remained on the path; between Tatyana and
him&mdash;or was it only his fancy?&mdash;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">-215-</a></span>
seemed to have happened ... unconsciously
and gradually.</p>

<p>‘Ah, she’s a wretch, a perfect wretch!’ Kapitolina
Markovna declared, shaking her head
commiseratingly; ‘why, with the price of <i>her</i>
get-up, you could keep not ten, but a hundred
families. Did you see under her hat, on <i>her</i>
red hair, there were diamonds? Upon my
word, diamonds in the day-time!’</p>

<p>‘Her hair’s not red,’ remarked Litvinov;
‘she dyes it red&mdash;that’s the fashion now.’</p>

<p>Again Kapitolina Markovna could only lift
her hands; she was positively dumbfounded.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said at last, ‘where we were, in
Dresden, things had not got to such a scandalous
pitch yet. It’s a little further from Paris, anyway,
that’s why. Don’t you think that’s it,
Grigory Mihalitch, eh?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t I think so?’ answered Litvinov. While
he thought to himself, ‘What on earth is she
talking of?’ ‘I? Of course ... of course....’</p>

<p>But at this point the sound of slow footsteps
was heard, and Potugin approached the seat.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, Grigory Mihalitch,’ he began,
smiling and nodding.</p>

<p>Litvinov grasped him by the hand at once.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, good-morning, Sozont
Ivanitch. I fancy I passed you just now with
... just now in the avenue?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">-216-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes, it was me.’</p>

<p>Potugin bowed respectfully to the ladies
sitting on the seat.</p>

<p>‘Let me introduce you, Sozont Ivanitch. Old
friends and relatives of mine, who have only just
arrived in Baden. Potugin, Sozont Ivanitch, a
countryman of ours, also staying in Baden.’</p>

<p>Both ladies rose a little. Potugin renewed
his bows.</p>

<p>‘It’s quite a levée here,’ Kapitolina Markovna
began in a delicate voice; the kind-hearted old
lady was easily intimidated, but she tried before
all to keep up her dignity. ‘Every one regards
it as an agreeable duty to stay here.’</p>

<p>‘Baden is an agreeable place, certainly,’
answered Potugin, with a sidelong look at
Tatyana; ‘a very agreeable place, Baden.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but it’s really too aristocratic, so far
as I can form an opinion. You see we have
been staying all this time in Dresden ... a
very interesting town; but here there’s positively
a levée.’</p>

<p>‘She’s pleased with the word,’ thought
Potugin. ‘You are perfectly right in that
observation,’ he said aloud; ‘but then the
scenery here is exquisite, and the site of
the place is something one cannot often find.
Your fellow-traveller especially is sure to
appreciate that. Are you not, madam?’ he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">-217-</a></span>
added, addressing himself this time directly to
Tatyana.</p>

<p>Tatyana raised her large, clear eyes to
Potugin. It seemed as though she were perplexed.
What was wanted of her, and why
had Litvinov introduced her, on the first day
of her arrival, to this unknown man, who had,
though, a kind and clever face, and was looking
at her with cordial and friendly eyes.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said at last, ‘it’s very nice here.’</p>

<p>‘You ought to visit the old castle,’ Potugin
went on; ‘I especially advise a drive to&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘The Saxon Switzerland&mdash;&mdash;’ Kapitolina
Markovna was beginning.</p>

<p>The blare of wind instruments floated up
the avenue; it was the Prussian military band
from Rastadt (in 1862 Rastadt was still an
allied fortress), beginning its weekly concert in
the pavilion. Kapitolina Markovna got up.</p>

<p>‘The music!’ she said; ‘the music <i>à la Conversation!</i>...
We must go there. It’s four
o’clock now ... isn’t it? Will the fashionable
world be there now?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Potugin: ‘this is the most
fashionable time, and the music is excellent.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, don’t let us linger. Tanya, come
along.’</p>

<p>‘You allow me to accompany you?’ asked
Potugin, to Litvinov’s considerable astonishment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">-218-</a></span>
it was not possible for it even to enter
his head that Irina had sent Potugin.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna simpered.</p>

<p>‘With the greatest pleasure&mdash;M’sieu ...
M’sieu&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Potugin,’ he murmured, and he offered her
his arm.</p>

<p>Litvinov gave his to Tatyana, and both
couples walked towards the Konversation Hall.</p>

<p>Potugin went on talking with Kapitolina
Markovna. But Litvinov walked without uttering
a word; yet twice, without any cause, he
smiled, and faintly pressed Tatyana’s arm
against his. There was a falsehood in those
demonstrations, to which she made no response,
and Litvinov was conscious of the lie. They
did not express a mutual confidence in the close
union of two souls given up to one another;
they were a temporary substitute&mdash;for words
which he could not find. That unspoken something
which was beginning between them grew
and gained strength. Once more Tatyana
looked attentively, almost intently, at him.</p>

<p>It was the same before the Konversation
Hall at the little table round which they all
four seated themselves, with this sole difference,
that, in the noisy bustle of the crowd, the clash
and roar of the music, Litvinov’s silence seemed
more comprehensible. Kapitolina Markovna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-219-</a></span>
became quite excited; Potugin hardly had
time to answer her questions, to satisfy her
curiosity. Luckily for him, there suddenly
appeared in the mass of moving figures the
lank person and everlastingly leaping eyes of
Madame Suhantchikov. Kapitolina Markovna
at once recognised her, invited her to their
table, made her sit down, and a hurricane of
words arose.</p>

<p>Potugin turned to Tatyana, and began a
conversation with her in a soft, subdued voice,
his face bent slightly down towards her with a
very friendly expression; and she, to her own
surprise, answered him easily and freely; she
was glad to talk with this stranger, this outsider,
while Litvinov sat immovable as before,
with the same fixed and unpleasant smile on
his lips.</p>

<p>Dinner-time came at last. The music ceased,
the crowd thinned. Kapitolina Markovna
parted from Madame Suhantchikov on the
warmest terms. She had conceived an immense
respect for her, though she did say afterwards to
her niece, that ‘this person is really too severe;
but then she does know everything and everybody;
and we must really get sewing-machines
directly the wedding festivities are over.’
Potugin took leave of them; Litvinov conducted
his ladies home. As they were going into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">-220-</a></span>
hotel, he was handed a note; he moved aside
and hurriedly tore open the envelope. On a
tiny scrap of vellum paper were the following
words, scribbled in pencil: ‘Come to me this
evening at seven, for one minute, I entreat you.&mdash;Irina.’
Litvinov thrust the note into his
pocket, and, turning round, put on his smile
again ... to whom? why? Tatyana was standing
with her back to him. They dined at the
common table of the hotel. Litvinov was
sitting between Kapitolina Markovna and
Tatyana, and he began talking, telling anecdotes
and pouring out wine for himself and
the ladies, with a strange, sudden joviality. He
conducted himself in such a free and easy
manner, that a French infantry officer from
Strasbourg, sitting opposite, with a beard and
moustaches <i>à la</i> Napoleon <span class="smaller">III.</span>, thought it
admissible to join in the conversation, and
even wound up by a toast <i>à la santé des belles
Moscovites!</i> After dinner, Litvinov escorted
the two ladies to their room, and after standing
a little while at the window with a scowl on his
face, he suddenly announced that he had to go
out for a short time on business, but would be
back without fail by the evening. Tatyana said
nothing; she turned pale and dropped her eyes.
Kapitolina Markovna was in the habit of taking
a nap after dinner; Tatyana was well aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">-221-</a></span>
that Litvinov knew of this habit of her aunt’s;
she had expected him to take advantage of it,
to remain with her, for he had not been alone
with her, nor spoken frankly to her, since her
arrival. And now he was going out! What
was she to make of it? And, indeed, his whole
behaviour all along....</p>

<p>Litvinov withdrew hurriedly, not waiting for
remonstrances; Kapitolina Markovna lay down
on the sofa, and with one or two sighs and
groans, fell into a serene sleep; while Tatyana
moved away into a corner, and sat down in a
low chair, folding her arms tightly across her
bosom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">-222-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov went quickly up the staircase of the
<i>Hôtel de l’Europe;</i> a little girl of thirteen, with a
sly little face of Kalmuck cast, who had apparently
been on the look-out for him, stopped him,
saying in Russian: ‘Come this way, please;
Irina Pavlovna will be here directly.’ He looked
at her in perplexity. She smiled, repeated:
‘Come along, come along,’ and led him to a
small room, facing Irina’s bedroom, and filled
with travelling trunks and portmanteaus, then at
once disappeared, closing the door very softly.
Litvinov had not time to look about him, before
the door was quickly opened, and before him in
a pink ball-dress, with pearls in her hair and
on her neck, stood Irina. She simply rushed at
him, clutched him by both hands, and for a few
instants was speechless; her eyes were shining,
and her bosom heaving as though she had run
up to a height.</p>

<p>‘I could not receive ... you there,’ she began
in a hurried whisper: ‘we are just going to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-223-</a></span>
dinner party, but I wanted above everything to
see you.... That is your betrothed, I suppose,
with whom I met you to-day?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that was my betrothed,’ said Litvinov,
with emphasis on the word ‘was.’</p>

<p>‘And so I wanted to see you for one
minute, to tell you that you must consider
yourself absolutely free, that everything that
happened yesterday ought not to affect your
plans....’</p>

<p>‘Irina!’ cried Litvinov, ‘why are you saying
this?’ He uttered these words in a loud voice.
There was the note in them of unbounded
passion. Irina involuntarily closed her eyes for
a minute.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my sweet one!’ she went on in a
whisper still more subdued, but with unrestrained
emotion, ‘you don’t know how I love
you, but yesterday I only paid my debt, I made
up for the past.... Ah! I could not give you
back my youth, as I would, but I have laid no
obligations on you, I have exacted no promise
of any sort of you, my sweet! Do what you
will, you are free as air, you are bound in no
way, understand that, understand that!’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t live without you, Irina,’ Litvinov
interrupted, in a whisper now; ‘I am yours for
ever and always, since yesterday.... I can only
breathe at your feet....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">-224-</a></span></p>

<p>He stooped down all in a tremble to kiss her
hands. Irina gazed at his bent head.</p>

<p>‘Then let me say,’ she said, ‘that I too am
ready for anything, that I too will consider no
one, and nothing. As you decide, so it shall
be. I, too, am for ever yours ... yours.’</p>

<p>Some one tapped warily at the door. Irina
stooped, whispered once more, ‘Yours ...
good-bye!’ Litvinov felt her breath on his
hair, the touch of her lips. When he stood
up, she was no longer in the room, but her
dress was rustling in the corridor, and from the
distance came the voice of Ratmirov: ‘<i>Eh
bien? Vous ne venez pas?</i>’</p>

<p>Litvinov sat down on a high chest, and hid
his face. A feminine fragrance, fresh and delicate,
clung about him.... Irina had held his
hand in her hands. ‘It’s too much, too much,’
was his thought. The little girl came into the
room, and smiling again in response to his
agitated glance, said:</p>

<p>‘Kindly come, now&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>He got up, and went out of the hotel. It
was no good even to think of returning home:
he had to regain his balance first. His heart
was beating heavily and unevenly; the earth
seemed faintly reeling under his feet. Litvinov
turned again along the Lichtenthaler Allee. He
realised that the decisive moment had come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">-225-</a></span>
that to put it off longer, to dissemble, to turn
away, had become impossible, that an explanation
with Tatyana had become inevitable; he
could imagine how she was sitting there, never
stirring, waiting for him ... he could foresee
what he would say to her; but how was he to act,
how was he to begin? He had turned his back
on his upright, well-organised, orderly future;
he knew that he was flinging himself headlong
into a gulf ... but that did not confound him.
The thing was done, but how was he to face
his judge? And if only his judge would come
to meet him&mdash;an angel with a flaming sword;
that would be easier for a sinning heart ...
instead of which he had himself to plunge the
knife in.... Infamous! But to turn back, to
abandon that other, to take advantage of the
freedom offered him, recognised as his....
No! better to die! No, he would have none of
such loathsome freedom ... but would humble
himself in the dust, and might those eyes look
down on him with love....</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ said a melancholy voice,
and some one’s hand was laid heavily upon
Litvinov.</p>

<p>He looked round in some alarm and recognised
Potugin.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, Grigory Mihalitch,’ began
the latter with his customary humility, ‘I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-226-</a></span>
disturbing you perhaps, but, seeing you in the
distance, I thought.... However if you’re not
in the humour....’</p>

<p>‘On the contrary I’m delighted,’ Litvinov
muttered between his teeth.</p>

<p>Potugin walked beside him.</p>

<p>‘What a lovely evening!’ he began, ‘so
warm! Have you been walking long?’</p>

<p>‘No, not long.’</p>

<p>‘Why do I ask though; I’ve just seen you
come out of the <i>Hôtel de l’Europe</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Then you’ve been following me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘You have something to say to me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Potugin repeated, hardly audibly.</p>

<p>Litvinov stopped and looked at his uninvited
companion. His face was pale, his eyes moved
restlessly; his contorted features seemed overshadowed
by old, long-standing grief.</p>

<p>‘What do you specially want to say to me?’
Litvinov said slowly, and he moved forward.</p>

<p>‘Ah, with your permission ... directly. If
it’s all the same to you, let us sit down here
on this seat. It will be most convenient.’</p>

<p>‘Why, this is something mysterious,’ Litvinov
declared, seating himself near him. ‘You don’t
seem quite yourself, Sozont Ivanitch.’</p>

<p>‘No; I’m all right; and it’s nothing
mysterious either. I specially wanted to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">-227-</a></span>
you ... the impression made on me by your
betrothed ... she is betrothed to you, I think?...
well, anyway, by the girl to whom you introduced
me to-day. I must say that in the
course of my whole existence I have never met
a more attractive creature. A heart of gold, a
really angelic nature.’</p>

<p>Potugin uttered all these words with the same
bitter and mournful air, so that even Litvinov
could not help noticing the incongruity between
his expression of face and his speech.</p>

<p>‘You have formed a perfectly correct estimate
of Tatyana Petrovna,’ Litvinov began, ‘though
I can’t help being surprised, first that you should
be aware of the relation in which I stand to
her; and secondly, that you should have understood
her so quickly. She really has an angelic
nature; but allow me to ask, did you want to
talk to me about this?’</p>

<p>‘It’s impossible not to understand her at
once,’ Potugin replied quickly, as though evading
the last question. ‘One need only take one
look into her eyes. She deserves every possible
happiness on earth, and enviable is the fate of
the man whose lot it is to give her that happiness!
One must hope he may prove worthy
of such a fate.’</p>

<p>Litvinov frowned slightly.</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, Sozont Ivanitch,’ he said, ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">-228-</a></span>
must confess our conversation strikes me as
altogether rather original.... I should like to
know, does the hint contained in your words
refer to me?’</p>

<p>Potugin did not at once answer Litvinov; he
was visibly struggling with himself.</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ he began at last, ‘either
I am completely mistaken in you, or you are
capable of hearing the truth, from whomsoever
it may come, and in however unattractive a
form it may present itself. I told you just now,
that I saw where you came from.’</p>

<p>‘Why, from the <i>Hôtel de l’Europe</i>. What of
that?’</p>

<p>‘I know, of course, whom you have been to
see there.’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘You have been to see Madame Ratmirov.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I have been to see her. What next?’</p>

<p>‘What next?... You, betrothed to Tatyana
Petrovna, have been to see Madame Ratmirov,
whom you love ... and who loves you.’</p>

<p>Litvinov instantly got up from the seat; the
blood rushed to his head.</p>

<p>‘What’s this?’ he cried at last, in a voice
of concentrated exasperation: ‘stupid jesting,
spying? Kindly explain yourself.’</p>

<p>Potugin turned a weary look upon him.</p>

<p>‘Ah! don’t be offended at my words. Grigory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">-229-</a></span>
Mihalitch, me you cannot offend. I did not
begin to talk to you for that, and I’m in no
joking humour now.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, perhaps. I’m ready to believe in
the excellence of your intentions; but still I
may be allowed to ask you by what right you
meddle in the private affairs, in the inner life, of
another man, a man who is nothing to you;
and what grounds you have for so confidently
giving out your own ... invention for the
truth?’</p>

<p>‘My invention! If I had imagined it, it
should not have made you angry; and as for
my right, well I never heard before that a man
ought to ask himself whether he had the right
to hold out a hand to a drowning man.’</p>

<p>‘I am humbly grateful for your tender solicitude,’
cried Litvinov passionately, ‘but I am not
in the least in need of it, and all the phrases
about the ruin of inexperienced young men
wrought by society women, about the immorality
of fashionable society, and so on, I look upon
merely as stock phrases, and indeed in a sense I
positively despise them; and so I beg you to
spare your rescuing arm, and to let me drown
in peace.’</p>

<p>Potugin again raised his eyes to Litvinov.
He was breathing hard, his lips were twitching.</p>

<p>‘But look at me, young man,’ broke from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">-230-</a></span>
at last, and he clapped himself on the breast:
‘can you suppose I have anything in common
with the ordinary, self-satisfied moralist, a
preacher? Don’t you understand that simply
from interest in you, however strong it might
be, I would never have let fall a word, I would
never have given you grounds for reproaching
me with what I hate above all things&mdash;indiscretion,
intrusiveness? Don’t you see that this
is something of a different kind altogether, that
before you is a man crushed, utterly obliterated
by the very passion, from the results of
which he would save you, and ... and for the
same woman!’</p>

<p>Litvinov stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>‘Is it possible? What did you say?... You
... you ... Sozont Ivanitch? But Madame
Byelsky ... that child?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, don’t cross-examine me.... Believe
me! That is a dark terrible story, and I’m
not going to tell you it. Madame Byelsky I
hardly knew, that child is not mine, but I took
it all upon myself ... because ... <i>she</i> wished
it, because it was necessary for <i>her</i>. Why am I
here in your hateful Baden? And, in fact,
could you suppose, could you for one instant
imagine, that I’d have brought myself to caution
you out of sympathy for you? I’m sorry for
that sweet, good girl, your <i>fiancée</i>, but what have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-231-</a></span>
I to do with your future, with you both?...
But I am afraid for her ... for her.’</p>

<p>‘You do me great honour, Mr. Potugin,’
began Litvinov, ‘but since, according to you,
we are both in the same position, why is it you
don’t apply such exhortations to yourself, and
ought I not to ascribe your apprehensions to
another feeling?’</p>

<p>‘That is to jealousy, you mean? Ah, young
man, young man, it’s shameful of you to shuffle
and make pretences, it’s shameful of you not
to realise what a bitter sorrow is speaking to
you now by my lips! No, I am not in the
same position as you! I, I am old, ridiculous,
an utterly harmless old fool&mdash;but you! But
there’s no need to talk about it! You would
not for one second agree to accept the position
I fill, and fill with gratitude! Jealousy? A
man is not jealous who has never had even a
drop of hope, and this is not the first time
it has been my lot to endure this feeling. I am
only afraid ... afraid for her, understand that.
And could I have guessed when she sent me to
you that the feeling of having wronged you&mdash;she
owned to feeling that&mdash;would carry her so far?’</p>

<p>‘But excuse me, Sozont Ivanitch, you seem
to know....’</p>

<p>‘I know nothing, and I know everything! I
know,’ he added, turning away, ‘I know where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-232-</a></span>
she was yesterday. But there’s no holding her
back now; like a stone set rolling, she must
roll on to the bottom. I should be a great
idiot indeed, if I imagined my words could hold
you back at once ... you, when a woman like
that.... But that’s enough of this. I couldn’t
restrain myself, that’s my whole excuse. And
after all how can one know, and why not try?
Perhaps, you will think again; perhaps, some
word of mine will go to your heart, you will
not care to ruin her and yourself, and that
innocent sweet creature.... Ah! don’t be
angry, don’t stamp about! What have I to
fear? Why should I mince matters? It’s not
jealousy speaking in me, not anger.... I’m
ready to fall at your feet, to beseech you....
Good-bye, though. You needn’t be afraid, all
this will be kept secret. I wished for your
good.’</p>

<p>Potugin strode off along the avenue and
quickly vanished in the now falling darkness.
Litvinov did not detain him.</p>

<p>‘A terrible dark story....’ Potugin had said
to Litvinov, and would not tell it.... Let us
pass it over with a few words only.</p>

<p>Eight years before, it had happened to him to
be sent by his department to Count Reisenbach
as a temporary clerk. It was in the summer.
Potugin used to drive to his country villa with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-233-</a></span>
papers, and be whole days there at a time.
Irina was then living at the count’s. She was
never haughty with people in a humbler station,
at least she never treated them superciliously,
and the countess more than once reproved her
for her excessive Moscow familiarity. Irina
soon detected a man of intelligence in the
humble clerk, attired in the stiffly buttoned
frockcoat that was his uniform. She used often
and eagerly to talk to him ... while he ...
he fell in love with her passionately, profoundly,
secretly.... Secretly! So <i>he</i> thought. The
summer passed; the count no longer needed
any outside assistance. Potugin lost sight of
Irina but could not forget her. Three years
after, he utterly unexpectedly received an invitation,
through a third person, to go to see a
lady slightly known to him. This lady at first
was reluctant to speak out, but after exacting
an oath from him to keep everything he was
going to hear absolutely secret, she proposed to
him ... to marry a girl, who occupied a conspicuous
position in society, and for whom
marriage had become a necessity. The lady
scarcely ventured to hint at the principal personage,
and then promised Potugin money ...
a large sum of money. Potugin was not
offended, astonishment stifled all feeling of
anger in him; but, of course, he point-blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">-234-</a></span>
declined. Then the lady handed him a note&mdash;from
Irina. ‘You are a generous, noble man,’
she wrote, ‘and I know you would do anything
for me; I beg of you this sacrifice. You will
save one who is very dear to me. In saving
her, you will save me too.... Do not ask me
how. I could never have brought myself to
any one with such an entreaty, but to you I
hold out my hands and say to you, do it for
my sake.’ Potugin pondered, and said that for
Irina Pavlovna, certainly he was ready to do a
great deal; but he should like to hear her wishes
from her own lips. The interview took place
the same evening; it did not last long, and no
one knew of it, except the same lady. Irina
was no longer living at Count Reisenbach’s.</p>

<p>‘What made you think of me, of all people?’
Potugin asked her.</p>

<p>She was beginning to expatiate on his noble
qualities, but suddenly she stopped....</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said, ‘you must be told the truth.
I know, I know that you love me; so that was
why I made up my mind ...’ and then she
told him everything.</p>

<p>Eliza Byelsky was an orphan; her relations
did not like her, and reckoned on her inheritance
... ruin was facing her. In saving her,
Irina was really doing a service to him who was
responsible for it all, and who was himself now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">-235-</a></span>
standing in a very close relation to Irina....
Potugin, without speaking, looked long at Irina,
and consented. She wept, and flung herself all
in tears on his neck. And he too wept ...
but very different were their tears. Everything
had already been made ready for the secret
marriage, a powerful hand removed all obstacles....
But illness came ... and then a daughter
was born, and then the mother ... poisoned
herself. What was to be done with the child?
Potugin received it into his charge, received it
from the same hands, from the hands of Irina.</p>

<p>A terrible dark story.... Let us pass on,
readers, pass on!</p>

<p>Over an hour more passed before Litvinov
could bring himself to go back to his hotel.
He had almost reached it when he suddenly
heard steps behind him. It seemed as though
they were following him persistently, and walking
faster when he quickened his pace. When
he moved under a lamp-post Litvinov turned
round and recognised General Ratmirov. In
a white tie, in a fashionable overcoat, flung
open, with a row of stars and crosses on a
golden chain in the buttonhole of his dresscoat,
the general was returning from dinner, alone.
His eyes, fastened with insolent persistence on
Litvinov, expressed such contempt and such
hatred, his whole deportment was suggestive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">-236-</a></span>
such intense defiance, that Litvinov thought it
his duty, stifling his wrath, to go to meet
him, to face a ‘scandal.’ But when he was on a
level with Litvinov, the general’s face suddenly
changed, his habitual playful refinement reappeared
upon it, and his hand in its pale
lavender glove flourished his glossy hat high
in the air. Litvinov took off his in silence, and
each went on his way.</p>

<p>‘He has noticed something, for certain!’
thought Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘If only it were ... any one else!’ thought
the general.</p>

<p>Tatyana was playing picquet with her aunt
when Litvinov entered their room.</p>

<p>‘Well, I must say, you’re a pretty fellow!’
cried Kapitolina Markovna, and she threw down
her cards. ‘Our first day, and he’s lost for the
whole evening! Here we’ve been waiting and
waiting, and scolding and scolding....’</p>

<p>‘I said nothing, aunt,’ observed Tatyana.</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re meekness itself, we all know!
You ought to be ashamed, sir! and you betrothed
too!’</p>

<p>Litvinov made some sort of excuse and sat
down to the table.</p>

<p>‘Why have you left off your game?’ he
asked after a brief silence.</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s a nice question! We’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">-237-</a></span>
playing cards from sheer dulness, not knowing
what to do with ourselves ... but now you’ve
come.’</p>

<p>‘If you would care to hear the evening
music,’ observed Litvinov, ‘I should be delighted
to take you.’</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna looked at her niece.</p>

<p>‘Let us go, aunt, I am ready,’ she said, ‘but
wouldn’t it be better to stay at home?’</p>

<p>‘To be sure! Let us have tea in our own old
Moscow way, with the samovar, and have a
good chat. We’ve not had a proper gossip
yet.’</p>

<p>Litvinov ordered tea to be sent up, but the
good chat did not come off. He felt a continual
gnawing of conscience; whatever he
said, it always seemed to him that he was telling
lies and Tatyana was seeing through it. Meanwhile
there was no change to be observed in
her; she behaved just as unconstrainedly ...
only her look never once rested upon Litvinov,
but with a kind of indulgent timorousness
glided over him, and she was paler than
usual.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna asked her whether she
had not a headache.</p>

<p>Tatyana was at first about to say no, but
after a moment’s thought, she said, ‘Yes, a
little.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">-238-</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s the journey,’ suggested Litvinov, and he
positively blushed with shame.</p>

<p>‘Yes, the journey,’ repeated Tatyana, and her
eyes again glided over him.</p>

<p>‘You ought to rest, Tanya darling.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will go to bed soon, aunt.’</p>

<p>On the table lay a <i>Guide des Voyageurs;</i> Litvinov
fell to reading aloud the description of
the environs of Baden.</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ Kapitolina Markovna interrupted,
‘but there’s something we mustn’t forget. I’m
told linen is very cheap here, so we must be
sure to buy some for the trousseau.’</p>

<p>Tatyana dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>‘We have plenty of time, aunt. You never
think of yourself, but you really ought to get
yourself some clothes. You see how smart
every one is here.’</p>

<p>‘Eh, my love! what would be the good of
that? I’m not a fine lady! It would be another
thing if I were such a beauty as your friend,
Grigory Mihalitch, what was her name?’</p>

<p>‘What friend?’</p>

<p>‘Why, that we met to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, she!’ said Litvinov, with feigned indifference,
and again he felt disgust and shame.
‘No!’ he thought, ‘to go on like this is impossible.’</p>

<p>He was sitting by his betrothed, while a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">-239-</a></span>
inches from her in his side pocket, was Irina’s
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna went for a minute into
the other room.</p>

<p>‘Tanya ...’ said Litvinov, with an effort.
It was the first time that day he had called her
by that name.</p>

<p>She turned towards him.</p>

<p>‘I ... I have something very important to
say to you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! really? when? directly?’</p>

<p>‘No, to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! to-morrow. Very well.’</p>

<p>Litvinov’s soul was suddenly filled with
boundless pity. He took Tatyana’s hand and
kissed it humbly, like a sinner; her heart
throbbed faintly and she felt no happiness.</p>

<p>In the night, at two o’clock, Kapitolina
Markovna, who was sleeping in the same room
with her niece, suddenly lifted up her head and
listened.</p>

<p>‘Tanya,’ she said, ‘you are crying?’</p>

<p>Tatyana did not at once answer.</p>

<p>‘No, aunt,’ sounded her gentle voice, ‘I’ve
caught a cold.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">-240-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">XX</a></h2>


<p>‘Why did I say that to her?’ Litvinov
thought the next morning as he sat in his
room at the window. He shrugged his shoulders
in vexation: he had said that to Tatyana
simply to cut himself off all way of retreat.
In the window lay a note from Irina: she
asked him to see her at twelve. Potugin’s
words incessantly recurred to his mind, they
seemed to reach him with a faint ill-omened
sound as of a rumbling underground. He
was angry with himself, but could not get rid
of them anyhow. Some one knocked at the
door.</p>

<p>‘<i>Wer da?</i>’ asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Ah! you’re at home! open!’ he heard
Bindasov’s hoarse bass.</p>

<p>The door handle creaked.</p>

<p>Litvinov turned white with exasperation.</p>

<p>‘I’m not at home,’ he declared sharply.</p>

<p>‘Not at home? That’s a good joke!’</p>

<p>‘I tell you&mdash;not at home, get along.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">-241-</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s civil! And I came to ask you for
a little loan,’ grumbled Bindasov.</p>

<p>He walked off, however, tramping on his
heels as usual.</p>

<p>Litvinov was all but dashing out after him,
he felt such a longing to throttle the hateful
ruffian. The events of the last few days had
unstrung his nerves; a little more, and he would
have burst into tears. He drank off a glass of
cold water, locked up all the drawers in the
furniture, he could not have said why, and
went to Tatyana’s.</p>

<p>He found her alone. Kapitolina Markovna
had gone out shopping. Tatyana was sitting on
the sofa, holding a book in both hands. She
was not reading it, and scarcely knew what
book it was. She did not stir, but her heart
was beating quickly in her bosom, and the
little white collar round her neck quivered
visibly and evenly.</p>

<p>Litvinov was confused.... However, he sat
down by her, said good-morning, smiled at her;
she too smiled at him without speaking. She
had bowed to him when he came in, bowed
courteously, not affectionately, and she did not
glance at him. He held out his hand to her;
she gave him her chill fingers, but at once freed
them again, and took up the book. Litvinov
felt that to begin the conversation with unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">-242-</a></span>
subjects would be insulting Tatyana;
she after her custom made no demands, but
everything in her said plainly, ‘I am waiting,
I am waiting.’... He must fulfil his promise.
But though almost the whole night he had
thought of nothing else, he had not prepared
even the first introductory words, and absolutely
did not know in what way to break this cruel
silence.</p>

<p>‘Tanya,’ he began at last, ‘I told you yesterday
that I have something important to say to
you. I am ready, only I beg you beforehand
not to be angry against me, and to rest assured
that my feelings for you....’</p>

<p>He stopped. He caught his breath. Tatyana
still did not stir, and did not look at
him; she only clutched the book tighter than
ever.</p>

<p>‘There has always been,’ Litvinov went on,
without finishing the sentence he had begun,
‘there has always been perfect openness between
us; I respect you too much to be a hypocrite
with you; I want to prove to you that I know
how to value the nobleness and independence
of your nature, even though ... though of
course....’</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ began Tatyana in a
measured voice while a deathly pallor overspread
her whole face, ‘I will come to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">-243-</a></span>
assistance, you no longer love me, and you
don’t know how to tell me so.’</p>

<p>Litvinov involuntarily shuddered.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ ... he said, hardly intelligibly,
‘why could you suppose?... I really don’t
understand....’</p>

<p>‘What! isn’t it the truth? Isn’t it the truth?&mdash;tell
me, tell me.’</p>

<p>Tatyana turned quite round to Litvinov; her
face, with her hair brushed back from it,
approached his face, and her eyes, which for so
long had not looked at him, seemed to penetrate
into his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it the truth?’ she repeated.</p>

<p>He said nothing, did not utter a single sound.
He could not have lied at that instant, even
if he had known she would believe him, and
that his lie would save her; he was not even
able to bear her eyes upon him. Litvinov said
nothing, but she needed no answer, she read
the answer in his very silence, in those guilty
downcast eyes&mdash;and she turned away again and
dropped the book.... She had been still
uncertain till that instant, and Litvinov understood
that; he understood that she had been
still uncertain&mdash;and how hideous, actually
hideous was all that he was doing.</p>

<p>He flung himself on his knees before her.</p>

<p>‘Tanya,’ he cried, ‘if only you knew how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">-244-</a></span>
hard it is for me to see you in this position,
how awful to me to think that it’s I ... I! My
heart is torn to pieces, I don’t know myself, I
have lost myself, and you, and everything....
Everything is shattered, Tanya, everything!
Could I dream that I ... I should bring such
a blow upon you, my best friend, my guardian
angel?... Could I dream that we should meet
like this, should spend such a day as yesterday!...’</p>

<p>Tatyana was trying to get up and go away.
He held her back by the border of her dress.</p>

<p>‘No, listen to me a minute longer. You see
I am on my knees before you, but I have not
come to beg your forgiveness; you cannot, you
ought not to forgive me. I have come to tell you
that your friend is ruined, that he is falling into
the pit, and would not drag you down with him....
But save me ... no! even you cannot save
me. I should push you away, I am ruined,
Tanya, I am ruined past all help.’</p>

<p>Tatyana looked at Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘You are ruined?’ she said, as though not fully
understanding him. ‘You are ruined?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Tanya, I am ruined. All the past, all
that was precious, everything I have lived for
up till now, is ruined for me; everything is
wretched, everything is shattered, and I don’t
know what awaits me in the future. You said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">-245-</a></span>
just now that I no longer loved you....
No, Tanya, I have not ceased to love you, but
a different, terrible, irresistible passion has come
upon me, has overborne me. I fought against
it while I could....’</p>

<p>Tatyana got up, her brows twitched, her pale
face darkened. Litvinov too rose to his feet.</p>

<p>‘You love another woman,’ she began, ‘and I
guess who she is.... We met her yesterday,
didn’t we?... Well, I see what is left for me
to do now. Since you say yourself this passion
is unalterable’ ... (Tatyana paused an instant,
possibly she had still hoped Litvinov would not
let this last word pass unchallenged, but he
said nothing), ‘it only remains for me to give
you back ... your word.’</p>

<p>Litvinov bent his head, as though submissively
receiving a well-deserved blow.</p>

<p>‘You have every right to be angry with me,’
he said. ‘You have every right to reproach
me for feebleness ... for deceit.’</p>

<p>Tatyana looked at him again.</p>

<p>‘I have not reproached you, Litvinov, I don’t
blame you. I agree with you: the bitterest
truth is better than what went on yesterday.
What sort of a life could ours have been
now!’</p>

<p>‘What sort of a life will mine be now!’
echoed mournfully in Litvinov’s soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">-246-</a></span></p>

<p>Tatyana went towards the door of the bedroom.</p>

<p>‘I will ask you to leave me alone for a little
time, Grigory Mihalitch&mdash;we will see each other
again, we will talk again. All this has been
so unexpected I want to collect myself a
little ... leave me alone ... spare my pride.
We shall see each other again.’</p>

<p>And uttering these words, Tatyana hurriedly
withdrew and locked the door after her.</p>

<p>Litvinov went out into the street like a man
dazed and stunned; in the very depths of his
heart something dark and bitter lay hid, such
a sensation must a man feel who has murdered
another; and at the same time he felt
easier as though he had at last flung off a
hated load. Tatyana’s magnanimity had crushed
him, he felt vividly all that he had lost ...
and yet? with his regret was mingled irritation;
he yearned towards Irina as to the sole refuge
left him, and felt bitter against her. For some
time Litvinov’s feelings had been every day
growing more violent and more complex; this
complexity tortured him, exasperated him, he
was lost in this chaos. He thirsted for one
thing; to get out at last on to the path, whatever
it might be, if only not to wander longer
in this incomprehensible half-darkness. Practical
people of Litvinov’s sort ought never to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">-247-</a></span>
carried away by passion, it destroys the very
meaning of their lives.... But nature cares
nothing for logic, our human logic; she has her
own, which we do not recognise and do not
acknowledge till we are crushed under its wheel.</p>

<p>On parting from Tatyana, Litvinov held one
thought in his mind, to see Irina; he set
off indeed to see her. But the general was
at home, so at least the porter told him, and
he did not care to go in, he did not feel
himself capable of hypocrisy, and he moved
slowly off towards the Konversation Hall.
Litvinov’s incapacity for hypocrisy was evident
that day to both Voroshilov and Pishtchalkin,
who happened to meet him; he simply
blurted out to the former that he was empty as
a drum; to the latter that he bored every one to
extinction; it was lucky indeed that Bindasov
did come across him; there would certainly
have been a ‘<i>grosser Scandal</i>.’ Both the young
men were stupefied; Voroshilov went so far as
to ask himself whether his honour as an officer
did not demand satisfaction? But like Gogol’s
lieutenant, Pirogov, he calmed himself with
bread and butter in a café. Litvinov caught
sight in the distance of Kapitolina Markovna
running busily from shop to shop in her striped
mantle.... He felt ashamed to face the good,
absurd, generous old lady. Then he recalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">-248-</a></span>
Potugin, their conversation yesterday.... Then
something was wafted to him, something intangible
and unmistakable: if a falling shadow
shed a fragrance, it could not be more elusive,
but he felt at once that it was Irina near him,
and in fact she appeared a few paces from him,
arm-in-arm with another lady; their eyes met
at once. Irina probably noticed something
peculiar in the expression of Litvinov’s face;
she stopped before a shop, in which a number
of tiny wooden clocks of Black Forest make
were exhibited, and summoning him by a
motion of her head, she pointed to one of these
clocks, and calling upon him to admire a charming
clock-face with a painted cuckoo above it,
she said, not in a whisper, but as though finishing
a phrase begun, in her ordinary tone of
voice, much less likely to attract the attention
of outsiders, ‘Come in an hour’s time, I shall
be alone.’</p>

<p>But at this moment the renowned lady-killer
Monsieur Verdier swooped down upon her, and
began to fall into ecstasies over the colour,
<i>feuille morte</i>, of her gown and the low-crowned
Spanish hat she wore tilted almost down to her
eyebrows.... Litvinov vanished in the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">-249-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a></h2>


<p>‘Grigory,’ Irina was saying to him two hours
later, as she sat beside him on the sofa, and
laid both hands on his shoulder, ‘what is the
matter with you? Tell me now quickly, while
we’re alone.’</p>

<p>‘The matter with me?’ said Litvinov. ‘I am
happy, happy, that’s what’s the matter with me.’</p>

<p>Irina looked down, smiled, sighed.</p>

<p>‘That’s not an answer to my question, my
dear one.’</p>

<p>Litvinov grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>‘Well, let me tell you then ... since you
insist positively on it’ (Irina opened her eyes
wide and trembled slightly), ‘I have told everything
to-day to my betrothed.’</p>

<p>‘What, everything? You mentioned me?’</p>

<p>Litvinov fairly threw up his arms.</p>

<p>‘Irina, for God’s sake, how could such an idea
enter your head! that I&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘There, forgive me ... forgive me. What
did you say?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">-250-</a></span></p>

<p>‘I told her that I no longer loved her.’</p>

<p>‘She asked why?’</p>

<p>‘I did not disguise the fact that I loved
another woman, and that we must part.’</p>

<p>‘Ah ... and what did she do? Agreed?’</p>

<p>‘O Irina! what a girl she is! She was all
self-sacrifice, all generosity!’</p>

<p>‘I’ve no doubt, I’ve no doubt ... there was
nothing else for her to do, though.’</p>

<p>‘And not one reproach, not one hard word
to me, who have spoiled her whole life, deceived
her, pitilessly flung her over....’</p>

<p>Irina scrutinised her finger nails.</p>

<p>‘Tell me, Grigory ... did she love you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Irina, she loved me.’</p>

<p>Irina was silent a minute, she straightened
her dress.</p>

<p>‘I must confess,’ she began, ‘I don’t quite
understand what induced you to explain matters
to her.’</p>

<p>‘What induced me, Irina! Would you have
liked me to lie, to be a hypocrite to her, that
pure soul? or did you suppose&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I supposed nothing,’ Irina interrupted. ‘I
must admit I have thought very little about her.
I don’t know how to think of two people at
once.’</p>

<p>‘That is, you mean&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Well, and so what then? Is she going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">-251-</a></span>
away, that pure soul?’ Irina interrupted a
second time.</p>

<p>‘I know nothing,’ answered Litvinov. ‘I am
to see her again. But she will not stay.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! <i>bon voyage!</i>’</p>

<p>‘No, she will not stay. But I’m not thinking
of her either now, I am thinking of what
you said to me, what you have promised me.’</p>

<p>Irina looked up at him from under her eyelids.</p>

<p>‘Ungrateful one! aren’t you content yet?’</p>

<p>‘No, Irina, I’m not content. You have made
me happy, but I’m not content, and you understand
me.’</p>

<p>‘That is, I&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you understand me. Remember your
words, remember what you wrote to me. I
can’t share you with others; no, no, I can’t
consent to the pitiful rôle of secret lover; not
my life alone, this other life too I have flung at
your feet, I have renounced everything, I have
crushed it all to dust, without compunction and
beyond recall; but in return I trust, I firmly
believe, that you too will keep your promise,
and unite your lot with mine for ever.’</p>

<p>‘You want me to run away with you? I am
ready....’ (Litvinov bent down to her hands
in ecstasy.) ‘I am ready. I will not go back
from my word. But have you yourself thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">-252-</a></span>
over all the difficulties&mdash;have you made preparations?’</p>

<p>‘I? I have not had time yet to think over
or prepare anything, but only say yes, let me
act, and before a month is over....’</p>

<p>‘A month! we start for Italy in a fortnight.’</p>

<p>‘A fortnight, then, is enough for me. O
Irina, you seem to take my proposition coldly;
perhaps it seems unpractical to you, but I am not
a boy, I am not used to comforting myself
with dreams, I know what a tremendous step
this is, I know what a responsibility I am taking
on myself; but I can see no other course.
Think of it, I must break every tie with the
past, if only not to be a contemptible liar
in the eyes of the girl I have sacrificed for
you!’</p>

<p>Irina drew herself up suddenly and her eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I beg your pardon, Grigory Mihalitch!
If I decide, if I run away, then it will at least
be with a man who does it for my sake, for my
sake simply, and not in order that he may not degrade
himself in the good opinion of a phlegmatic
young person, with milk and water, <i>du lait coupé</i>
instead of blood, in her veins! And I must tell
you too, it’s the first time, I confess, that it’s
been my lot to hear that the man I honour
with my regard is deserving of commiseration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">-253-</a></span>
playing a pitiful part! I know a far more
pitiful part, the part of a man who doesn’t know
what is going on in his own heart!’</p>

<p>Litvinov drew himself up in his turn.</p>

<p>‘Irina,’ he was beginning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But all at once she clapped both hands to her
forehead, and with a convulsive motion, flinging
herself on his breast, she embraced him with
force beyond a woman’s.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, forgive me,’ she began, with a
shaking voice, ‘forgive me, Grigory! You
see how corrupted I am, how horrid I am, how
jealous and wicked! You see how I need your
aid, your indulgence! Yes, save me, drag me
out of this mire, before I am quite ruined!
Yes, let us run away, let us run away from these
people, from this society to some far off, fair,
free country! Perhaps your Irina will at last
be worthier of the sacrifices you are making for
her! Don’t be angry with me, forgive me, my
sweet, and know that I will do everything you
command, I will go anywhere you will take me!’</p>

<p>Litvinov’s heart was in a turmoil. Irina clung
closer than before to him with all her youthful
supple body. He bent over her fragrant, disordered
tresses, and in an intoxication of gratitude
and ecstasy, he hardly dared to caress
them with his hand, he hardly touched them
with his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">-254-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Irina, Irina,’ he repeated,&mdash;‘my angel....’</p>

<p>She suddenly raised her head, listened....</p>

<p>‘It’s my husband’s step, ... he has gone
into his room,’ she whispered, and, moving
hurriedly away, she crossed over to another
armchair. Litvinov was getting up.... ‘What
are you doing?’ she went on in the same whisper;
‘you must stay, he suspects you as it is.
Or are you afraid of him?’ She did not take
her eyes off the door. ‘Yes, it’s he; he will come
in here directly. Tell me something, talk to me.’
Litvinov could not at once recover himself and
was silent. ‘Aren’t you going to the theatre to-morrow?’
she uttered aloud. ‘They’re giving
<i>Le Verre d’Eau</i>, an old-fashioned piece, and
Plessy is awfully affected.... We’re as though
we were in a perfect fever,’ she added, dropping
her voice. ‘We can’t do anything like this; we
must think things over well. I ought to warn you
that all my money is in his hands; <i>mais j’ai
mes bijoux</i>. We’ll go to Spain, would you like
that?’ She raised her voice again. ‘Why is it
all actresses get so fat? Madeleine Brohan for
instance.... Do talk, don’t sit so silent. My
head is going round. But you, you must not
doubt me.... I will let you know where to
come to-morrow. Only it was a mistake to have
told that young lady.... <i>Ah, mais c’est charmant!</i>’
she cried suddenly and with a nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">-255-</a></span>
laugh, she tore the lace edge of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’ asked Ratmirov from the
other room.</p>

<p>‘Yes ... yes.’</p>

<p>The door opened, and in the doorway
appeared the general. He scowled on seeing
Litvinov; however, he bowed to them, that
is to say, he bent the upper portion of his
person.</p>

<p>‘I did not know you had a visitor,’ he said:
‘<i>je vous demande pardon de mon indiscrétion</i>. So
you still find Baden entertaining, M’sieu&mdash;Litvinov?’</p>

<p>Ratmirov always uttered Litvinov’s surname
with hesitation, every time, as though he had
forgotten it, and could not at once recall it....
In this way, as well as by the lofty flourish of
his hat in saluting him, he meant to insult his
pride.</p>

<p>‘I am not bored here, <i>m’sieu le général</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Really? Well, I find Baden fearfully boring.
We are soon going away, are we not, Irina
Pavlovna? <i>Assez de Bade comme ça.</i> By the
way, I’ve won you five hundred francs to-day.’</p>

<p>Irina stretched out her hand coquettishly.</p>

<p>‘Where are they? Please let me have them
for pin-money.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">-256-</a></span></p>

<p>‘You shall have them, you shall have them....
You are going, M’sieu&mdash;Litvinov?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am going, as you see.’</p>

<p>Ratmirov again bent his body.</p>

<p>‘Till we meet again!’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Grigory Mihalitch,’ said Irina. ‘I
will keep my promise.’</p>

<p>‘What is that? May I be inquisitive?’ her
husband queried.</p>

<p>Irina smiled.</p>

<p>‘No, it was only ... something we’ve been
talking of. <i>C’est à propos du voyage ... où il
vous plaira.</i> You know&mdash;Stael’s book?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! ah! to be sure, I know. Charming
illustrations.’</p>

<p>Ratmirov seemed on the best of terms with
his wife; he called her by her pet name in
addressing her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">-257-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII</a></h2>


<p>‘Better not think now, really,’ Litvinov repeated,
as he strode along the street, feeling
that the inward riot was rising up again in him.
‘The thing’s decided. She will keep her promise,
and it only remains for me to take all
necessary steps.... Yet she hesitates, it
seems.’... He shook his head. His own
designs struck even his own imagination in a
strange light; there was a smack of artificiality,
of unreality about them. One cannot
dwell long upon the same thoughts; they
gradually shift like the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope
... one peeps in, and already the
shapes before one’s eyes are utterly different.
A sensation of intense weariness overcame Litvinov....
If he could for one short hour but
rest!... But Tanya? He started, and, without
reflecting even, turned submissively homewards,
merely struck by the idea, that this day was
tossing him like a ball from one to the other....
No matter; he must make an end. He went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">-258-</a></span>
back to his hotel, and with the same submissiveness,
insensibility, numbness, without hesitation
or delay, he went to see Tatyana.</p>

<p>He was met by Kapitolina Markovna. From
the first glance at her, he knew that she knew
about it all; the poor maiden lady’s eyes were
swollen with weeping, and her flushed face,
fringed with her dishevelled white locks, expressed
dismay and an agony of indignation,
sorrow, and boundless amazement. She was on
the point of rushing up to Litvinov, but she
stopped short, and, biting her quivering lip, she
looked at him as though she would supplicate
him, and kill him, and assure herself that it
was a dream, a senseless, impossible thing,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p>‘Here you ... you are come,’ she began....
The door from the next room opened instantaneously,
and with a light tread Tatyana came
in; she was of a transparent pallor, but she
was quite calm.</p>

<p>She gently put one arm round her aunt and
made her sit down beside her.</p>

<p>‘You sit down too, Grigory Mihalitch,’ she said
to Litvinov, who was standing like one distraught
at the door. ‘I am very glad to see
you once more. I have informed auntie of your
decision, our common decision; she fully shares
it and approves of it.... Without mutual love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">-259-</a></span>
there can be no happiness, mutual esteem alone
is not enough’ (at the word ‘esteem’ Litvinov
involuntarily looked down) ‘and better to separate
now, than to repent later. Isn’t it, aunt?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course,’ began Kapitolina Markovna,
‘of course, Tanya darling, the man who does
not know how to appreciate you ... who could
bring himself&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Aunt, aunt,’ Tatyana interrupted, ‘remember
what you promised me. You always told
me yourself: truth, Tatyana, truth before everything&mdash;and
independence. Well, truth’s not
always sweet, nor independence either; or else
where would be the virtue of it?’</p>

<p>She kissed Kapitolina Markovna on her
white hair, and turning to Litvinov, she went
on:</p>

<p>‘We propose, aunt and I, leaving Baden....
I think it will be more comfortable so for all
of us.’</p>

<p>‘When do you think of going?’ Litvinov
said thickly. He remembered that Irina had
said the very same words to him not long
before.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna was darting forward,
but Tatyana held her back, with a caressing
touch on her shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Probably soon, very soon.’</p>

<p>‘And will you allow me to ask where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">-260-</a></span>
intend going?’ Litvinov said in the same
voice.</p>

<p>‘First to Dresden, then probably to Russia.’</p>

<p>‘But what can you want to know that for
now, Grigory Mihalitch?’ ... cried Kapitolina
Markovna.</p>

<p>‘Aunt, aunt,’ Tatyana interposed again. A
brief silence followed.</p>

<p>‘Tatyana Petrovna,’ began Litvinov, ‘you
know how agonisingly painful and bitter my
feelings must be at this instant.’</p>

<p>Tatyana got up.</p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch,’ she said, ‘we will not
talk about that ... if you please, I beg you
for my sake, if not for your own. I have
known you long enough, and I can very
well imagine what you must be feeling now.
But what’s the use of talking, of touching a
sore’ (she stopped; it was clear she wanted
to stem the emotion rushing upon her, to
swallow the rising tears; she succeeded)&mdash;‘why
fret a sore we cannot heal? Leave that to time.
And now I have to ask a service of you, Grigory
Mihalitch; if you will be so good, I will give you
a letter directly: take it to the post yourself,
it is rather important, but aunt and I have no
time now.... I shall be much obliged to you.
Wait a minute.... I will bring it directly....’</p>

<p>In the doorway Tatyana glanced uneasily at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">-261-</a></span>
Kapitolina Markovna; but she was sitting with
such dignity and decorum, with such a severe
expression on her knitted brows and tightly
compressed lips, that Tatyana merely gave her
a significant nod and went out.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the door closed behind her,
when every trace of dignity and severity instantaneously
vanished from Kapitolina Markovna’s
face; she got up, ran on tiptoe up to Litvinov,
and all hunched together and trying to look
him in the face, she began in a quaking tearful
whisper:</p>

<p>‘Good God,’ she said, ‘Grigory Mihalitch, what
does it mean? is it a dream or what? <i>You</i> give
up Tanya, you tired of her, you breaking your
word! You doing this, Grigory Mihalitch, you
on whom we all counted as if you were a stone
wall! You? you? you, Grisha?’... Kapitolina
Markovna stopped. ‘Why, you will kill her,
Grigory Mihalitch,’ she went on, without waiting
for an answer, while her tears fairly coursed in fine
drops over her cheeks. ‘You mustn’t judge by
her bearing up now, you know her character!
She never complains; she does not think of herself,
so others must think of her! She keeps saying
to me, “Aunt, we must save our dignity!”
but what’s dignity, when I foresee death, death
before us?’... Tatyana’s chair creaked in the
next room. ‘Yes, I foresee death,’ the old lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-262-</a></span>
went on still more softly. ‘And how can such a
thing have come about? Is it witchcraft, or
what? It’s not long since you were writing
her the tenderest letters. And in fact can an
honest man act like this? I’m a woman, free,
as you know, from prejudice of any sort, <i>esprit
fort</i>, and I have given Tanya too the same sort
of education, she too has a free mind....’</p>

<p>‘Aunt!’ came Tatyana’s voice from the next
room.</p>

<p>‘But one’s word of honour is a duty, Grigory
Mihalitch, especially for people of your, of my
principles! If we’re not going to recognise
duty, what is left us? This cannot be broken
off in this way, at your whim, without regard to
what may happen to another! It’s unprincipled
... yes, it’s a crime; a strange sort of
freedom!’</p>

<p>‘Aunt, come here please,’ was heard again.</p>

<p>‘I’m coming, my love, I’m coming....’
Kapitolina Markovna clutched at Litvinov’s
hand.&mdash;‘I see you are angry, Grigory Mihalitch.’...
(‘Me! me angry?’ he wanted to exclaim,
but his tongue was dumb.) ‘I don’t want to
make you angry&mdash;oh, really, quite the contrary!
I’ve come even to entreat you; think again while
there is time; don’t destroy her, don’t destroy
your own happiness, she will still trust you,
Grisha, she will believe in you, nothing is lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">-263-</a></span>
yet; why, she loves you as no one will ever love
you! Leave this hateful Baden-Baden, let us
go away together, only throw off this enchantment,
and, above all, have pity, have pity&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Aunt!’ called Tatyana, with a shade of impatience
in her voice.</p>

<p>But Kapitolina Markovna did not hear her.</p>

<p>‘Only say “yes,”’ she repeated to Litvinov;
‘and I will still make everything smooth....
You need only nod your head to me, just one
little nod like this.’</p>

<p>Litvinov would gladly, he felt, have died at
that instant; but the word ‘yes’ he did not
utter, and he did not nod his head.</p>

<p>Tatyana reappeared with a letter in her hand.
Kapitolina Markovna at once darted away from
Litvinov, and, averting her face, bent low over
the table, as though she were looking over the
bills and papers that lay on it.</p>

<p>Tatyana went up to Litvinov.</p>

<p>‘Here,’ she said, ‘is the letter I spoke of....
You will go to the post at once with it, won’t
you?’</p>

<p>Litvinov raised his eyes.... Before him,
really, stood his judge. Tatyana struck him as
taller, slenderer; her face, shining with unwonted
beauty, had the stony grandeur of a statue’s;
her bosom did not heave, and her gown, of one
colour and straight as a Greek chiton, fell in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">-264-</a></span>
long, unbroken folds of marble drapery to her
feet, which were hidden by it. Tatyana was
looking straight before her, only at Litvinov;
her cold, calm gaze, too, was the gaze of a
statue. He read his sentence in it; he bowed,
took a letter from the hand held out so immovably
to him, and silently withdrew.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna ran to Tatyana; but the
latter turned off her embraces and dropped her
eyes; a flush of colour spread over her face, and
with the words, ‘and now, the sooner the better,’
she went into the bedroom. Kapitolina Markovna
followed her with hanging head.</p>

<p>The letter, entrusted to Litvinov by Tatyana,
was addressed to one of her Dresden friends&mdash;a
German lady&mdash;who let small furnished apartments.
Litvinov dropped the letter into the
post-box, and it seemed to him as though with
that tiny scrap of paper he was dropping all
his past, all his life into the tomb. He went
out of the town, and strolled a long time by
narrow paths between vineyards; he could not
shake off the persistent sensation of contempt
for himself, like the importunate buzzing of flies
in summer: an unenviable part, indeed, he had
played in the last interview.... And when he
went back to his hotel, and after a little time
inquired about the ladies, he was told that
immediately after he had gone out, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">-265-</a></span>
given orders to be driven to the railway station,
and had departed by the mail train&mdash;to what
destination was not known. Their things had
been packed and their bills paid ever since the
morning. Tatyana had asked Litvinov to take
her letter to the post, obviously with the object
of getting him out of the way. He ventured
to ask the hall-porter whether the ladies had
left any letters for him, but the porter replied
in the negative, and looked amazed even; it
was clear that this sudden exit from rooms
taken for a week struck him too as strange and
dubious. Litvinov turned his back on him, and
locked himself up in his room.</p>

<p>He did not leave it till the following day: the
greater part of the night he was sitting at the
table, writing, and tearing what he had written....
The dawn was already beginning when he
finished his task&mdash;it was a letter to Irina.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">-266-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII</a></h2>


<p>This was what was in this letter to Irina:</p>

<p>‘My betrothed went away yesterday; we
shall never see each other again.... I do not
know even for certain where she is going to
live. With her, she takes all that till now
seemed precious and desirable to me; all my
previous ideas, my plans, my intentions, have
gone with her; my labours even are wasted, my
work of years ends in nothing, all my pursuits
have no meaning, no applicability; all that is
dead; myself, my old self, is dead and buried
since yesterday. I feel, I see, I know this
clearly ... far am I from regretting this.
Not to lament of it, have I begun upon
this to you.... As though I could complain
when you love me, Irina! I wanted only
to tell you that, of all this dead past, all
those hopes and efforts, turned to smoke and
ashes, there is only one thing left living,
invincible, my love for you. Except that love,
nothing is left for me; to say it is the sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">-267-</a></span>
thing precious to me, would be too little; I live
wholly in that love; that love is my whole
being; in it are my future, my career, my vocation,
my country! You know me, Irina; you
know that fine talk of any sort is foreign to my
nature, hateful to me, and however strong the
words in which I try to express my feelings, you
will have no doubts of their sincerity, you will
not suppose them exaggerated. I’m not a boy,
in the impulse of momentary ecstasy, lisping
unreflecting vows to you, but a man of matured
age&mdash;simply and plainly, almost with terror,
telling you what he has recognised for unmistakable
truth. Yes, your love has replaced
everything for me&mdash;everything, everything!
Judge for yourself: can I leave this my <i>all</i> in
the hands of another? can I let him dispose of
you? You&mdash;you will belong to him, my whole
being, my heart’s blood will belong to him&mdash;while
I myself ... where am I? what am I?
An outsider&mdash;an onlooker ... looking on at
my own life! No, that’s impossible, impossible!
To share, to share in secret that without
which it’s useless, impossible to live ... that’s
deceit and death. I know how great a
sacrifice I am asking of you, without any sort
of right to it; indeed, what can give one a
right to sacrifice? But I am not acting thus
from egoism: an egoist would find it easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-268-</a></span>
and smoother not to raise this question at all.
Yes, my demands are difficult, and I am not
surprised that they alarm you. The people
among whom you have to live are hateful to
you, you are sick of society, but are you strong
enough to throw up that society? to trample on
the success it has crowned you with? to rouse
public opinion against you&mdash;the opinion of these
hateful people? Ask yourself, Irina, don’t take
a burden upon you greater than you can bear.
I don’t want to reproach you; but remember:
once already you could not hold out against
temptation. I can give you so little in return
for all you are losing. Hear my last word: if
you don’t feel capable to-morrow, to-day even,
of leaving all and following me&mdash;you see
how boldly I speak, how little I spare myself,&mdash;if
you are frightened at the uncertainty of the
future, and estrangement and solitude and the
censure of men, if you cannot rely on yourself,
in fact, tell me so openly and without delay,
and I will go away; I shall go with a broken
heart, but I shall bless you for your truthfulness.
But if you really, my beautiful, radiant
queen, love a man so petty, so obscure as I, and
are really ready to share his fate,&mdash;well, then,
give me your hand, and let us set off together
on our difficult way! Only understand, my
decision is unchanging; either all or nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-269-</a></span>
It’s unreasonable ... but I could not do
otherwise&mdash;I cannot, Irina! I love you too
much.&mdash;Yours, <span style="margin-left: 5em;">G. L.’</span></p>

<p>Litvinov did not much like this letter himself;
it did not quite truly and exactly express
what he wanted to say; it was full of awkward
expressions, high flown or bookish, and doubtless
it was not better than many of the other
letters he had torn up; but it was the last, the
chief point was thoroughly stated anyway, and
harassed, and worn out, Litvinov did not feel
capable of dragging anything else out of his
head. Besides he did not possess the faculty
of putting his thought into literary form, and
like all people with whom it is not habitual, he
took great trouble over the style. His first
letter was probably the best; it came warmer
from the heart. However that might be,
Litvinov despatched his missive to Irina.</p>

<p>She replied in a brief note:</p>

<p>‘Come to me to-day,’ she wrote to him: ‘<i>he</i>
has gone away for the whole day. Your letter
has greatly disturbed me. I keep thinking,
thinking ... and my head is in a whirl. I
am very wretched, but you love me, and I am
happy. Come. Yours, <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I.’</span></p>

<p>She was sitting in her boudoir when Litvinov
went in. He was conducted there by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">-270-</a></span>
little girl of thirteen who on the previous day
had watched for him on the stairs. On the
table before Irina was standing an open, semi-circular,
cardboard box of lace: she was carelessly
turning over the lace with one hand, in
the other she was holding Litvinov’s letter. She
had only just left off crying; her eyelashes were
wet, and her eyelids swollen; on her cheeks
could be seen the traces of undried tears not
wiped away. Litvinov stood still in the doorway;
she did not notice his entrance.</p>

<p>‘You are crying?’ he said wonderingly.</p>

<p>She started, passed her hand over her hair
and smiled.</p>

<p>‘Why are you crying?’ repeated Litvinov.
She pointed in silence to the letter. ‘So you
were ... over that,’ he articulated haltingly.</p>

<p>‘Come here, sit down,’ she said, ‘give me
your hand. Well, yes, I was crying ... what
are you surprised at? Is that nothing?’ she
pointed again to the letter.</p>

<p>Litvinov sat down.</p>

<p>‘I know it’s not easy, Irina, I tell you so indeed
in my letter ... I understand your position.
But if you believe in the value of your love
for me, if my words have convinced you, you
ought, too, to understand what I feel now at the
sight of your tears. I have come here, like a
man on his trial, and I await what is to be my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">-271-</a></span>
sentence? Death or life? Your answer decides
everything. Only don’t look at me with those
eyes.... They remind me of the eyes I saw in
old days in Moscow.’</p>

<p>Irina flushed at once, and turned away, as
though herself conscious of something evil in
her gaze.</p>

<p>‘Why do you say that, Grigory? For shame!
You want to know my answer ... do you
mean to say you can doubt it? You are
troubled by my tears ... but you don’t understand
them. Your letter, dearest, has set me
thinking. Here you write that my love has
replaced everything for you, that even your
former studies can never now be put into practice;
but I ask myself, can a man live for love
alone? Won’t it weary him at last, won’t he
want an active career, and won’t he cast the
blame on what drew him away from active life?
That’s the thought that dismays me, that’s
what I am afraid of, and not what you imagine.’</p>

<p>Litvinov looked intently at Irina, and Irina
intently looked at him, as though each would
penetrate deeper and further into the soul of
the other, deeper and further than word can
reach, or word betray.</p>

<p>‘You are wrong in being afraid of that,’ began
Litvinov. ‘I must have expressed myself badly.
Weariness? Inactivity? With the new impetus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">-272-</a></span>
your love will give me? O Irina, in your love
there’s a whole world for me, and I can’t yet
foresee myself what may develop from it.’</p>

<p>Irina grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>‘Where are we going?’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘Where? We will talk of that later. But, of
course, then ... then you agree? you agree, Irina?’</p>

<p>She looked at him. ‘And you will be happy?’</p>

<p>‘O Irina!’</p>

<p>‘You will regret nothing? Never?’</p>

<p>She bent over the cardboard box, and again
began looking over the lace in it.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be angry with me, dear one, for
attending to this trash at such a moment....
I am obliged to go to a ball at a certain lady’s,
these bits of finery have been sent me, and
I must choose to-day. Ah! I am awfully
wretched!’ she cried suddenly, and she laid her
face down on the edge of the box. Tears began
falling again from her eyes.... She turned
away; the tears might spoil the lace.</p>

<p>‘Irina, you are crying again,’ Litvinov began
uneasily.</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, again,’ Irina interposed hurriedly.
‘O Grigory, don’t torture me, don’t torture
yourself!... Let us be free people! What
does it matter if I do cry! And indeed do I
know myself why my tears are flowing? You
know, you have heard my decision, you believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">-273-</a></span>
it will not be changed. That I agree to ... What
was it you said?... to all or nothing ... what
more would you have? Let us be
free! Why these mutual chains? We are alone
together now, you love me. I love you; is it
possible we have nothing to do but wringing our
thoughts out of each other? Look at me, I
don’t want to talk about myself, I have never
by one word hinted that for me perhaps it was
not so easy to set at nought my duty as a wife ... and,
of course, I don’t deceive myself, I
know I am a criminal, and that <i>he</i> has a right
to kill me. Well, what of it? Let us be free,
I say. To-day is ours&mdash;a life-time’s ours.’</p>

<p>She got up from the arm-chair and looked at
Litvinov with her head thrown back, faintly smiling
and moving her eyebrows, while with one
arm bare to the elbow she pushed back from her
face a long tress on which a few tears glistened.
A rich scarf slipped from the table and fell on
the floor at Irina’s feet. She trampled contemptuously
on it. ‘Or don’t you like me, to-day?
Have I grown ugly since yesterday? Tell me,
have you often seen a prettier hand? And this
hair? Tell me, do you love me?’</p>

<p>She clasped him in both arms, held his head
close to her bosom, her comb fell out with a
ringing sound, and her falling hair wrapped
him in a soft flood of fragrance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">-274-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV">XXIV</a></h2>


<p>Litvinov walked up and down his room in the
hotel, his head bowed in thought. He had now
to pass from theory to practice, to devise ways
and means for flight, for moving to unknown
countries.... But, strange to say, he was not
pondering so much upon ways and means as
upon whether actually, beyond doubt, the
decision had been reached on which he had so
obstinately insisted? Had the ultimate, irrevocable
word been uttered? But Irina to be
sure had said to him at parting, ‘Act, act, and
when every thing is ready, only let me know.’
That was final! Away with all doubts.... He
must proceed to action. And Litvinov proceeded&mdash;in
the meantime&mdash;to calculation. Money
first of all. Litvinov had, he found, in ready
money one thousand three hundred and twenty-eight
guldens, in French money, two thousand
eight hundred and fifty-five francs; the sum
was trifling, but it was enough for the first
necessities, and then he must at once write to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">-275-</a></span>
his father to send him all he could; he would
have to sell the forest part of the land. But
on what pretext?... Well, a pretext would
be found. Irina had spoken, it’s true, of her
<i>bijoux</i>, but that must not be taken into his
reckoning; that, who knows, might come in for
a rainy day. He had besides a good Geneva
watch, for which he might get ... well, say, four
hundred francs. Litvinov went to a banker’s,
and with much circumlocution introduced the
question whether it was possible, in case of
need, to borrow money; but bankers at Baden
are wary old foxes, and in response to such circumlocutions
they promptly assume a drooping
and blighted air, for all the world like a wild
flower whose stalk has been severed by the
scythe; some indeed laugh outright in your
face, as though appreciating an innocent joke
on your part. Litvinov, to his shame, even
tried his luck at roulette, even, oh ignominy!
put a thaler on the number thirty, corresponding
with his own age. He did this with a view
to augmenting and rounding off his capital;
and if he did not augment it, he certainly
did round off his capital by losing the odd
twenty-eight guldens. There was a second
question, also not an unimportant one; that
was the passport. But for a woman a passport
is not quite so obligatory, and there are countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">-276-</a></span>
where it is not required at all, Belgium, for
instance, and England; besides, one might even
get some other passport, not Russian. Litvinov
pondered very seriously on all this; his decision
was firm, absolutely unwavering, and yet all the
time against his will, overriding his will, something
not serious, almost humorous came in,
filtered through his musings, as though the very
enterprise were a comic business, and no one
ever did elope with any one in reality, but only
in plays and novels, and perhaps somewhere
in the provinces, in some of those remote
districts, where, according to the statements of
travellers, people are literally sick continually
from <i>ennui</i>. At that point Litvinov recalled
how an acquaintance of his, a retired cornet,
Batsov, had eloped with a merchant’s daughter
in a staging sledge with bells and three horses,
having as a preliminary measure made the
parents drunk, and adopted the same precaution
as well with the bride, and how, as it
afterwards turned out, he was outwitted and
within an ace of a thrashing into the bargain.
Litvinov felt exceedingly irritated with himself
for such inappropriate reminiscences, and then
with the recollection of Tatyana, her sudden departure,
all that grief and suffering and shame,
he felt only too acutely that the affair he was
arranging was deadly earnest, and how right he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">-277-</a></span>
had been when he had told Irina that his honour
even left no other course open.... And again
at the mere name something of flame turned
with sweet ache about his heart and died away
again.</p>

<p>The tramp of horses’ hoofs sounded behind
him.... He moved aside.... Irina overtook
him on horseback; beside her rode the stout
general. She recognised Litvinov, nodded to
him, and lashing her horse with a sidestroke of
her whip, she put him into a gallop, and suddenly
dashed away at headlong speed. Her dark
veil fluttered in the wind....</p>

<p>‘<i>Pas si vite! Nom de Dieu! pas si vite!</i>’
cried the general, and he too galloped after her.</p>

<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV">XXV</a></h2>


<p>The next morning Litvinov had only just come
home from seeing the banker, with whom he
had had another conversation on the playful instability
of our exchange, and the best means
of sending money abroad, when the hotel porter
handed him a letter. He recognised Irina’s
handwriting, and without breaking the seal&mdash;a
presentiment of evil, Heaven knows why, was
astir in him&mdash;he went into his room. This was
what he read (the letter was in French):</p>

<p>‘My dear one, I have been thinking all
night of your plan.... I am not going to
shuffle with you. You have been open with
me, and I will be open with you; I <i>cannot</i>
run away with you, I <i>have not the strength</i> to
do it. I feel how I am wronging you; my
second sin is greater than the first, I despise
myself, my cowardice, I cover myself with
reproaches, but I cannot change myself. In
vain I tell myself that I have destroyed your
happiness, that you have the right now to regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">-279-</a></span>
me as a frivolous flirt, that I myself drew
you on, that I have given you solemn promises.... I
am full of horror, of hatred for myself,
but I can’t do otherwise, I can’t, I can’t. I
don’t want to justify myself, I won’t tell you I
was carried away myself ... all that’s of no
importance; but I want to tell you, and to say
it again and yet again, I am yours, yours for ever,
do with me as you will when you will, free from all
obligation, from all responsibility! I am yours....
But run away, throw up everything ...
no! no! no! I besought you to save me, I
hoped to wipe out everything, to burn up the
past as in a fire ... but I see there is no
salvation for me; I see the poison has gone
too deeply into me; I see one cannot breathe
this atmosphere for years with impunity. I
have long hesitated whether to write you this
letter, I dread to think what decision you may
come to, I trust only to your love for me. But
I felt it would be dishonest on my part to hide
the truth from you&mdash;especially as perhaps you
have already begun to take the first steps for
carrying out our project. Ah! it was lovely
but impracticable. O my dear one, think me
a weak, worthless woman, despise, but don’t
abandon me, don’t abandon your Irina!...
To leave this life I have not the courage, but
live it without you I cannot either. We soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">-280-</a></span>
go back to Petersburg, come there, live there,
we will find occupation for you, your labours in
the past shall not be thrown away, you shall
find good use for them ... only live near me,
only love me; such as I am, with all my
weaknesses and my vices, and believe me, no
heart will ever be so tenderly devoted to you as
the heart of your Irina. Come soon to me, I
shall not have an instant’s peace until I see
you.&mdash;Yours, yours, yours, <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I.’</span></p>

<p>The blood beat like a sledge-hammer in
Litvinov’s head, then slowly and painfully sank
to his heart, and was chill as a stone in it. He
read through Irina’s letter, and just as on that
day at Moscow he fell in exhaustion on the
sofa, and stayed there motionless. A dark
abyss seemed suddenly to have opened on all
sides of him, and he stared into this darkness
in senseless despair. And so again, again
deceit, no, worse than deceit, lying and baseness....
And life shattered, everything torn
up by its roots utterly, and the sole thing which
he could cling to&mdash;the last prop in fragments
too! ‘Come after us to Petersburg,’ he repeated
with a bitter inward laugh, ‘we will find
you occupation.... Find me a place as a head
clerk, eh? and who are <i>we?</i> Here there’s a hint
of her past. Here we have the secret, hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">-281-</a></span>
something I know nothing of, but which she has
been trying to wipe out, to burn as in a fire.
Here we have that world of intrigues, of secret
relations, of shameful stories of Byelskys and
Dolskys.... And what a future, what a lovely part
awaiting me! To live close to her, visit her, share
with her the morbid melancholy of the lady of
fashion who is sick and weary of the world,
but can’t live outside its circle, be the friend of
the house of course, of his Excellency ... until
... until the whim changes and the plebeian
lover loses his piquancy, and is replaced by
that fat general or Mr. Finikov&mdash;that’s possible
and pleasant, and I dare say useful.... She
talks of a good use for my talents?... but the
other project’s impracticable, impracticable....’
In Litvinov’s soul rose, like sudden gusts
of wind before a storm, momentary impulses
of fury.... Every expression in Irina’s letter
roused his indignation, her very assertions of
her unchanging feelings affronted him. ‘She
can’t let it go like that,’ he cried at last, ‘I won’t
allow her to play with my life so mercilessly.’</p>

<p>Litvinov jumped up, snatched his hat. But
what was he to do? Run to her? Answer
her letter? He stopped short, and his hands
fell.</p>

<p>‘Yes; what was to be done?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">-282-</a></span></p>

<p>Had he not himself put this fatal choice to
her? It had not turned out as he had wished
... there was that risk about every choice.
She had changed her mind, it was true; she
herself had declared at first that she would
throw up everything and follow him; that was
true too; but she did not deny her guilt, she
called herself a weak woman; she did not want
to deceive him, she had been deceived in herself....
What answer could be made to that?
At any rate she was not hypocritical, she was not
deceiving him ... she was open, remorselessly
open. There was nothing forced her to speak
out, nothing to prevent her from soothing him
with promises, putting things off, and keeping
it all in uncertainty till her departure ... till
her departure with her husband for Italy?
But she had ruined his life, ruined two lives....
What of that?</p>

<p>But as regards Tatyana, she was not guilty;
the guilt was his, his, Litvinov’s alone, and he
had no right to shake off the responsibility his
own sin had laid with iron yoke upon him....
All this was so; but what was left him to do
now?</p>

<p>Again he flung himself on the sofa and
again in gloom, darkly, dimly, without trace,
with devouring swiftness, the minutes raced
past....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">-283-</a></span></p>

<p>‘And why not obey her?’ flashed through his
brain. ‘She loves me, she is mine, and in our
very yearning towards each other, in this passion,
which after so many years has burst upon us,
and forced its way out with such violence, is
there not something inevitable, irresistible, like
a law of nature? Live in Petersburg ... and
shall I be the first to be put in such a position?
And how could we be in safety together?...’</p>

<p>And he fell to musing, and Irina’s shape, in
the guise in which it was imprinted for ever in
his late memories, softly rose before him....
But not for long.... He mastered himself,
and with a fresh outburst of indignation drove
away from him both those memories and that
seductive image.</p>

<p>‘You give me to drink from that golden cup,’
he cried, ‘but there is poison in the draught,
and your white wings are besmirched with mire....
Away! Remain here with you after the
way I ... I drove away my betrothed ... a
deed of infamy, of infamy!’ He wrung his
hands with anguish, and another face with the
stamp of suffering on its still features, with
dumb reproach in its farewell eyes, rose from
the depths....</p>

<p>And for a long time Litvinov was in this
agony still; for a long time, his tortured thought,
like a man fever-stricken, tossed from side to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">-284-</a></span>
side.... He grew calm at last; at last he
came to a decision. From the very first instant
he had a presentiment of this decision;
... it had appeared to him at first like a
distant, hardly perceptible point in the midst of
the darkness and turmoil of his inward conflict;
then it had begun to move nearer and nearer,
till it ended by cutting with icy edge into his
heart.</p>

<p>Litvinov once more dragged his box out of
the corner, once more he packed all his things,
without haste, even with a kind of stupid carefulness,
rang for the waiter, paid his bill, and
despatched to Irina a note in Russian to the
following purport:</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether you are doing me a
greater wrong now than then; but I know this
present blow is infinitely heavier.... It is the
end. You tell me, “I cannot”; and I repeat
to you, “I cannot ...” do what you want. I
cannot and I don’t want to. Don’t answer me.
You are not capable of giving me the only
answer I would accept. I am going away
to-morrow early by the first train. Good-bye,
may you be happy! We shall in all probability
not see each other again.’</p>

<p>Till night-time Litvinov did not leave his
room; God knows whether he was expecting
anything. About seven o’clock in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">-285-</a></span>
a lady in a black mantle with a veil on her
face twice approached the steps of his hotel.
Moving a little aside and gazing far away
into the distance, she suddenly made a resolute
gesture with her hand, and for the third time
went towards the steps....</p>

<p>‘Where are you going, Irina Pavlovna?’ she
heard a voice utter with effort behind her.</p>

<p>She turned with nervous swiftness....
Potugin ran up to her.</p>

<p>She stopped short, thought a moment, and
fairly flung herself towards him, took his arm,
and drew him away.</p>

<p>‘Take me away, take me away,’ she repeated
breathlessly.</p>

<p>‘What is it, Irina Pavlovna?’ he muttered in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Take me away,’ she reiterated with redoubled
force, ‘if you don’t want me to remain for ever
... there.’</p>

<p>Potugin bent his head submissively, and hurriedly
they went away together.</p>

<p>The following morning early Litvinov was
perfectly ready for his journey&mdash;into his room
walked ... Potugin.</p>

<p>He went up to him in silence, and in silence
shook his hand. Litvinov, too, said nothing.
Both of them wore long faces, and both vainly
tried to smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">-286-</a></span></p>

<p>‘I came to wish you a good journey,’ Potugin
brought out at last.</p>

<p>‘And how did you know I was going to-day?’
asked Litvinov.</p>

<p>Potugin looked on the floor around him....
‘I became aware of it ... as you see. Our last
conversation took in the end such a strange
turn.... I did not want to part from you
without expressing my sincere good feeling
for you.’</p>

<p>‘You have good feeling for me now ... when
I am going away?’</p>

<p>Potugin looked mournfully at Litvinov. ‘Ah,
Grigory Mihalitch, Grigory Mihalitch,’ he began
with a short sigh, ‘it’s no time for that with us
now, no time for delicacy or fencing. You don’t,
so far as I have been able to perceive, take much
interest in our national literature, and so, perhaps,
you have no clear conception of Vaska
Buslaev?’</p>

<p>‘Of whom?’</p>

<p>‘Of Vaska Buslaev, the hero of Novgorod ...
in Kirsch-Danilov’s collection.’</p>

<p>‘What Buslaev?’ said Litvinov, somewhat
puzzled by the unexpected turn of the conversation.
‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘Well, never mind. I only wanted to draw
your attention to something. Vaska Buslaev,
after he had taken away his Novgorodians on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">-287-</a></span>
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and there, to their
horror, bathed all naked in the holy river
Jordan, for he believed not “in omen nor in
dream, nor in the flight of birds,” this logical
Vaska Buslaev climbed up Mount Tabor,
and on the top of this mountain there lies a
great stone, over which men of every kind have
tried in vain to jump.... Vaska too ventured
to try his luck. And he chanced upon a dead
head, a human skull in his road; he kicked it
away with his foot. So the skull said to him;
“Why do you kick me? I knew how to live,
and I know how to roll in the dust&mdash;and it will
be the same with you.” And in fact, Vaska
jumps over the stone, and he did quite clear it,
but he caught his heel and broke his skull.
And in this place, I must by the way observe
that it wouldn’t be amiss for our friends, the
Slavophils, who are so fond of kicking dead
heads and decaying nationalities underfoot to
ponder over that legend.’</p>

<p>‘But what does all that mean?’ Litvinov
interposed impatiently at last. ‘Excuse me,
it’s time for me....’</p>

<p>‘Why, this,’ answered Potugin, and his eyes
beamed with such affectionate warmth as Litvinov
had not even expected of him, ‘this, that
you do not spurn a dead human head, and for
your goodness, perhaps you may succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">-288-</a></span>
leaping over the fatal stone. I won’t keep
you any longer, only let me embrace you at
parting.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not going to try to leap over it even,’
Litvinov declared, kissing Potugin three times,
and the bitter sensations filling his soul were
replaced for an instant by pity for the poor
lonely creature.</p>

<p>‘But I must go, I must go ...’ he moved
about the room.</p>

<p>‘Can I carry anything for you?’ Potugin
proffered his services.</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, don’t trouble, I can manage....’</p>

<p>He put on his cap, took up his bag. ‘So
you say,’ he queried, stopping in the doorway,
‘you have seen her?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ve seen her.’</p>

<p>‘Well ... tell me about her.’</p>

<p>Potugin was silent a moment. ‘She expected
you yesterday ... and to-day she will expect
you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Well, tell her.... No, there’s no
need, no need of anything. Good-bye....
Good-bye!’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Grigory Mihalitch.... Let me
say one word more to you. You still have time
to listen to me; there’s more than half an hour
before the train starts. You are returning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">-289-</a></span>
Russia.... There you will ... in time ...
get to work.... Allow an old chatterbox&mdash;for,
alas, I am a chatterbox, and nothing more&mdash;to
give you advice for your journey. Every time it
is your lot to undertake any piece of work, ask
yourself: Are you serving the cause of civilisation,
in the true and strict sense of the word;
are you promoting one of the ideals of civilisation;
have your labours that educating, Europeanising
character which alone is beneficial and
profitable in our day among us? If it is so, go
boldly forward, you are on the right path, and
your work is a blessing! Thank God for it!
You are not alone now. You will not be a
“sower in the desert”; there are plenty of
workers ... pioneers ... even among us now....
But you have no ears for this now. Good-bye,
don’t forget me!’</p>

<p>Litvinov descended the staircase at a run,
flung himself into a carriage, and drove to the
station, not once looking round at the town
where so much of his personal life was left
behind. He abandoned himself, as it were, to
the tide; it snatched him up and bore him
along, and he firmly resolved not to struggle
against it ... all other exercise of independent
will he renounced.</p>

<p>He was just taking his seat in the railway
carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">-290-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Grigory Mihalitch ... Grigory....’ he heard
a supplicating whisper behind him.</p>

<p>He started.... Could it be Irina? Yes; it
was she. Wrapped in her maid’s shawl, a
travelling hat on her dishevelled hair, she was
standing on the platform, and gazing at him
with worn and weary eyes.</p>

<p>‘Come back, come back, I have come for
you,’ those eyes were saying. And what, what
were they not promising? She did not move,
she had not power to add a word; everything
about her, even the disorder of her dress, everything
seemed entreating forgiveness....</p>

<p>Litvinov was almost beaten, scarcely could
he keep from rushing to her.... But the tide
to which he had surrendered himself reasserted
itself.... He jumped into the carriage, and
turning round, he motioned Irina to a place
beside him. She understood him. There was
still time. One step, one movement, and two
lives made one for ever would have been hurried
away into the uncertain distance.... While
she wavered, a loud whistle sounded and the
train moved off.</p>

<p>Litvinov sank back, while Irina moved
staggering to a seat, and fell on it, to the immense
astonishment of a supernumerary diplomatic
official who chanced to be lounging about
the railway station. He was slightly acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">-291-</a></span>
with Irina, and greatly admired her, and seeing
that she lay as though overcome by faintness,
he imagined that she had ‘<i>une attaque de nerfs</i>,’
and therefore deemed it his duty, the duty <i>d’un
galant chevalier</i>, to go to her assistance. But
his astonishment assumed far greater proportions
when, at the first word addressed to her,
she suddenly got up, repulsed his proffered
arm, and hurrying out into the street, had in a
few instants vanished in the milky vapour of
fog, so characteristic of the climate of the Black
Forest in the early days of autumn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">-292-</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI">XXVI</a></h2>


<p>We happened once to go into the hut of a
peasant-woman who had just lost her only,
passionately loved son, and to our considerable
astonishment we found her perfectly calm,
almost cheerful. ‘Let her be,’ said her husband,
to whom probably our astonishment was apparent,
‘she is gone numb now.’ And Litvinov
had in the same way ‘gone numb.’ The same
sort of calm came over him during the first
few hours of the journey. Utterly crushed,
hopelessly wretched as he was, still he was at
rest, at rest after the agonies and sufferings of
the last few weeks, after all the blows which had
fallen one after another upon his head. They
had been the more shattering for him that he
was little fitted by nature for such tempests.
Now he really hoped for nothing, and tried not
to remember, above all not to remember. He
was going to Russia ... he had to go somewhere;
but he was making no kind of plans
regarding his own personality. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">-293-</a></span>
recognise himself, he did not comprehend his
own actions, he had positively lost his real
identity, and, in fact, he took very little interest
in his own identity. Sometimes it seemed
to him that he was taking his own corpse
home, and only the bitter spasms of irremediable
spiritual pain passing over him from time
to time brought him back to a sense of still
being alive. At times it struck him as incomprehensible
that a man&mdash;a man!&mdash;could let a
woman, let love, have such power over him ...
‘Ignominious weakness!’ he muttered, and
shook back his cloak, and sat up more squarely;
as though to say, the past is over, let’s begin
fresh ... a moment, and he could only smile
bitterly and wonder at himself. He fell to
looking out of the window. It was grey and
damp; there was no rain, but the fog still hung
about; and low clouds trailed across the sky.
The wind blew facing the train; whitish clouds
of steam, some singly, others mingled with other
darker clouds of smoke, whirled in endless file
past the window at which Litvinov was sitting.
He began to watch this steam, this smoke.
Incessantly mounting, rising and falling, twisting
and hooking on to the grass, to the bushes
as though in sportive antics, lengthening out,
and hiding away, clouds upon clouds flew
by ... they were for ever changing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">-294-</a></span>
stayed still the same in their monotonous,
hurrying, wearisome sport! Sometimes the
wind changed, the line bent to right or left,
and suddenly the whole mass vanished, and at
once reappeared at the opposite window; then
again the huge tail was flung out, and again it
veiled Litvinov’s view of the vast plain of the
Rhine. He gazed and gazed, and a strange
reverie came over him.... He was alone in the
compartment; there was no one to disturb him.
‘Smoke, smoke,’ he repeated several times; and
suddenly it all seemed as smoke to him, everything,
his own life, Russian life&mdash;everything
human, especially everything Russian. All
smoke and steam, he thought; all seems for
ever changing, on all sides new forms, phantoms
flying after phantoms, while in reality
it is all the same and the same again; everything
hurrying, flying towards something, and
everything vanishing without a trace, attaining
to nothing; another wind blows, and all is
dashing in the opposite direction, and there
again the same untiring, restless&mdash;and useless
gambols! He remembered much that had
taken place with clamour and flourish before
his eyes in the last few years ... ‘Smoke,’ he
whispered, ‘smoke’; he remembered the hot
disputes, the wrangling, the clamour at Gubaryov’s,
and in other sets of men, of high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">-295-</a></span>
low degree, advanced and reactionist, old and
young ... ‘Smoke,’ he repeated, ‘smoke and
steam’; he remembered, too, the fashionable
picnic, and he remembered various opinions
and speeches of other political personages&mdash;even
all Potugin’s sermonising ... ‘Smoke,
smoke, nothing but smoke.’ And what of his
own struggles and passions and agonies and
dreams? He could only reply with a gesture
of despair.</p>

<p>And meanwhile the train dashed on and
on; by now Rastadt, Carlsruhe, and Bruchsal
had long been left far behind; the mountains
on the right side of the line swerved
aside, retreated into the distance, then
moved up again, but not so high, and
more thinly covered with trees.... The
train made a sharp turn ... and there was
Heidelberg. The carriage rolled in under the
cover of the station; there was the shouting
of newspaper-boys, selling papers of all sorts,
even Russian; passengers began bustling in
their seats, getting out on to the platform, but
Litvinov did not leave his corner, and still sat
on with downcast head. Suddenly some one
called him by name; he raised his eyes; Bindasov’s
ugly phiz was thrust in at the window;
and behind him&mdash;or was he dreaming, no, it
was really so&mdash;all the familiar Baden faces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">-296-</a></span>
there was Madame Suhantchikov, there was
Voroshilov, and Bambaev too; they all rushed
up to him, while Bindasov bellowed:</p>

<p>‘But where’s Pishtchalkin? We were expecting
him; but it’s all the same, hop out,
and we’ll be off to Gubaryov’s.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my boy, yes, Gubaryov’s expecting us,’
Bambaev confirmed, making way for him, ‘hop
out.’</p>

<p>Litvinov would have flown into a rage,
but for a dead load lying on his heart. He
glanced at Bindasov and turned away without
speaking.</p>

<p>‘I tell you Gubaryov’s here,’ shrieked
Madame Suhantchikov, her eyes fairly starting
out of her head.</p>

<p>Litvinov did not stir a muscle.</p>

<p>‘Come, do listen, Litvinov,’ Bambaev began
at last, ‘there’s not only Gubaryov here,
there’s a whole phalanx here of the most
splendid, most intellectual young fellows, Russians&mdash;and
all studying the natural sciences,
all of the noblest convictions! Really you
must stop here, if it’s only for them. Here,
for instance, there’s a certain ... there, I’ve
forgotten his surname, but he’s a genius!
simply!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, let him be, let him be, Rostislav Ardalionovitch,’
interposed Madame Suhantchikov,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">-297-</a></span>
‘let him be! You see what sort of a fellow he
is; and all his family are the same. He has
an aunt; at first she struck me as a sensible
woman, but the day before yesterday I went to
see her here&mdash;she had only just before gone to
Baden and was back here again before you
could look round&mdash;well, I went to see her;
began questioning her.... Would you believe
me, I couldn’t get a word out of the stuck-up
thing. Horrid aristocrat!’</p>

<p>Poor Kapitolina Markovna an aristocrat!
Could she ever have anticipated such a humiliation?</p>

<p>But Litvinov still held his peace, turned
away, and pulled his cap over his eyes. The
train started at last.</p>

<p>‘Well, say something at parting at least, you
stonyhearted man!’ shouted Bambaev, ‘this is
really too much!’</p>

<p>‘Rotten milksop!’ yelled Bindasov. The
carriages were moving more and more rapidly,
and he could vent his abuse with impunity.
‘Niggardly stick-in-the-mud.’</p>

<p>Whether Bindasov invented this last appellation
on the spot, or whether it had come to
him second-hand, it apparently gave great
satisfaction to two of the noble young fellows
studying natural science, who happened to be
standing by, for only a few days later it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">-298-</a></span>
appeared in the Russian periodical sheet,
published at that time at Heidelberg under the
title: <i>A tout venant je crache!</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> or, ‘We don’t
care a hang for anybody!’</p>

<p>But Litvinov repeated again, ‘Smoke, smoke,
smoke! Here,’ he thought, ‘in Heidelberg now
are over a hundred Russian students; they’re
all studying chemistry, physics, physiology&mdash;they
won’t even hear of anything else ...
but in five or six years’ time there won’t be
fifteen at the lectures by the same celebrated
professors; the wind will change, the smoke
will be blowing ... in another quarter ...
smoke ... smoke...!’<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Towards nightfall he passed by Cassel. With
the darkness intolerable anguish pounced like
a hawk upon him, and he wept, burying himself
in the corner of the carriage. For a long
time his tears flowed, not easing his heart, but
torturing him with a sort of gnawing bitterness;
while at the same time, in one of the
hotels of Cassel, Tatyana was lying in bed
feverishly ill.</p>

<p>Kapitolina Markovna was sitting beside her.
‘Tanya,’ she was saying, ‘for God’s sake, let
me send a telegram to Grigory Mihalitch, do
let me, Tanya!’</p>

<p>‘No, aunt,’ she answered; ‘you mustn’t;
don’t be frightened, give me some water; it
will soon pass.’</p>

<p>And a week later she did, in fact, recover,
and the two friends continued their journey.</p>

<p>Stopping neither at Petersburg nor at Moscow,
Litvinov went back to his estate. He was dismayed
when he saw his father; the latter was
so weak and failing. The old man rejoiced to
have his son, as far as a man can rejoice who is
just at the close of life; he at once gave over to
him the management of everything, which was
in great disorder, and lingering on a few weeks
longer, he departed from this earthly sphere.
Litvinov was left alone in his ancient little
manor-house, and with a heavy heart, without
hope, without zeal, and without money, he
began to work the land. Working the land is
a cheerless business, as many know too well;
we will not enlarge on how distasteful it
seemed to Litvinov. As for reforms and
innovations, there was, of course, no question
even of them; the practical application of the
information he had gathered abroad was put off
for an indefinite period; poverty forced him to
make shift from day to day, to consent to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">-301-</a></span>
sorts of compromises&mdash;both material and moral.
The new had ‘begun ill,’ the old had lost all
power; ignorance jostled up against dishonesty;
the whole agrarian organisation was shaken and
unstable as quagmire bog, and only one great
word, ‘freedom,’ was wafted like the breath of
God over the waters. Patience was needed
before all things, and a patience not passive, but
active, persistent, not without tact and cunning
at times.... For Litvinov, in his frame of
mind, it was doubly hard. He had but little
will to live left in him.... Where was he to
get the will to labour and take trouble?</p>

<p>But a year passed, after it another passed,
the third was beginning. The mighty idea was
being realised by degrees, was passing into
flesh and blood, the young shoot had sprung
up from the scattered seed, and its foes, both
open and secret, could not stamp it out now.
Litvinov himself, though he had ended by
giving up the greater part of his land to the
peasants on the half-profit system, that’s to say,
by returning to the wretched primitive methods,
had yet succeeded in doing something; he had
restored the factory, set up a tiny farm with
five free hired labourers&mdash;he had had at different
times fully forty&mdash;and had paid his principal
private debts.... And his spirit had gained
strength; he had begun to be like the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">-302-</a></span>
Litvinov again. It’s true, a deeply buried
melancholy never left him, and he was too quiet
for his years; he shut himself up in a narrow
circle and broke off all his old connections ...
but the deadly indifference had passed, and
among the living he moved and acted as a living
man again. The last traces, too, had vanished
of the enchantment in which he had been held;
all that had passed at Baden appeared to him
dimly as in a dream.... And Irina? even she
had paled and vanished too, and Litvinov only
had a faint sense of something dangerous behind
the mist that gradually enfolded her image.
Of Tatyana news reached him from time to
time; he knew that she was living with her aunt
on her estate, a hundred and sixty miles from
him, leading a quiet life, going out little, and
scarcely receiving any guests&mdash;cheerful and well,
however. It happened on one fine May day,
that he was sitting in his study, listlessly turning
over the last number of a Petersburg paper;
a servant came to announce the arrival of an
old uncle. This uncle happened to be a cousin
of Kapitolina Markovna and had been recently
staying with her. He had bought an estate in
Litvinov’s vicinity and was on his way thither.
He stayed twenty-four hours with his nephew
and told him a great deal about Tatyana’s
manner of life. The next day after his departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">-303-</a></span>
Litvinov sent her a letter, the first since
their separation. He begged for permission to
renew her acquaintance, at least by correspondence,
and also desired to learn whether he must
for ever give up all idea of some day seeing her
again? Not without emotion he awaited the
answer ... the answer came at last. Tatyana
responded cordially to his overture. ‘If you
are disposed to pay us a visit,’ she finished up,
‘we hope you will come; you know the saying,
“even the sick are easier together than apart.”’
Kapitolina Markovna joined in sending her
regards. Litvinov was as happy as a child; it
was long since his heart had beaten with such
delight over anything. He felt suddenly light
and bright.... Just as when the sun rises and
drives away the darkness of night, a light breeze
flutters with the sun’s rays over the face of the
reviving earth. All that day Litvinov kept
smiling, even while he went about his farm and
gave his orders. He at once began making
arrangements for the journey, and a fortnight
later he was on his way to Tatyana.</p>

<p>He drove rather slowly by cross tracks, without
any special adventures; only once the tire of
a hind wheel broke; a blacksmith hammered and
welded it, swearing both at the tire and at himself,
and positively flung up the job; luckily it
turned out that among us one can travel capitally
even with a tire broken, especially on the ‘soft,’
that’s to say on the mud. On the other
hand, Litvinov did come upon some rather
curious chance-meetings. At one place he
found a Board of Mediators sitting, and
at the head of it Pishtchalkin, who made
on him the impression of a Solon or a Solomon,
such lofty wisdom characterised his remarks,
and such boundless respect was shown him
both by landowners and peasants.... In
exterior, too, he had begun to resemble a sage
of antiquity; his hair had fallen off the crown
of his head, and his full face had completely
set in a sort of solemn jelly of positively
blatant virtue. He expressed his pleasure at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">-305-</a></span>
Litvinov’s arrival in&mdash;‘if I may make bold to
use so ambitious an expression, my own district,’
and altogether seemed fairly overcome by an
excess of excellent intentions. One piece of
news he did, however, succeed in communicating,
and that was about Voroshilov; the
hero of the Golden Board had re-entered
military service, and had already had time to
deliver a lecture to the officers of his regiment
on Buddhism or Dynamism, or something of the
sort&mdash;Pishtchalkin could not quite remember.
At the next station it was a long while before
the horses were in readiness for Litvinov; it
was early dawn, and he was dozing as he sat
in his coach. A voice, that struck him as
familiar, waked him up; he opened his eyes....
Heavens! wasn’t it Gubaryov in a grey pea-jacket
and full flapping pyjamas standing on
the steps of the posting hut, swearing?...
No, it wasn’t Mr. Gubaryov.... But what a
striking resemblance!... Only this worthy
had a mouth even wider, teeth even bigger, the
expression of his dull eyes was more savage
and his nose coarser, and his beard thicker, and
the whole countenance heavier and more repulsive.</p>

<p>‘Scou-oundrels, scou-oundrels!’ he vociferated
slowly and viciously, his wolfish mouth
gaping wide. ‘Filthy louts.... Here you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">-306-</a></span>
have ... vaunted freedom indeed ... and can’t
get horses ... scou-oundrels!’</p>

<p>‘Scou-oundrels, scou-oundrels!’ thereupon
came the sound of another voice from within,
and at the same moment there appeared on the
steps&mdash;also in a grey smoking pea-jacket and
pyjamas&mdash;actually, unmistakably, the real Gubaryov
himself, Stepan Nikolaevitch Gubaryov.
‘Filthy louts!’ he went on in imitation of his
brother (it turned out that the first gentleman
was his elder brother, the man of the old school,
famous for his fists, who had managed his estate).
‘Flogging’s what they want, that’s it; a tap or
two on the snout, that’s the sort of freedom for
them.... Self-government indeed.... I’d
let them know it.... But where is that
M’sieu Roston?... What is he thinking about?...
It’s his business, the lazy scamp ... to
see we’re not put to inconvenience.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I told you, brother,’ began the elder
Gubaryov, ‘that he was a lazy scamp, no good
in fact! But there, for the sake of old times,
you ... M’sieu Roston, M’sieu Roston!...
Where have you got to?’</p>

<p>‘Roston! Roston!’ bawled the younger, the
great Gubaryov. ‘Give a good call for him, do
brother Dorimedont Nikolaitch!’</p>

<p>‘Well, I am shouting for him, Stepan Nikolaitch!
M’sieu Roston!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">-307-</a></span></p>

<p>‘Here I am, here I am, here I am!’ was
heard a hurried voice, and round the corner of
the hut skipped Bambaev.</p>

<p>Litvinov fairly gasped. On the unlucky
enthusiast a shabby braided coat, with holes
in the elbows, dangled ruefully; his features
had not exactly changed, but they looked
pinched and drawn together; his over-anxious
little eyes expressed a cringing timorousness
and hungry servility; but his dyed whiskers
stood out as of old above his swollen lips. The
Gubaryov brothers with one accord promptly
set to scolding him from the top of the steps;
he stopped, facing them below, in the mud, and
with his spine curved deprecatingly, he tried
to propitiate them with a little nervous smile,
kneading his cap in his red fingers, shifting
from one foot to the other, and muttering that
the horses would be here directly.... But
the brothers did not cease, till the younger at
last cast his eyes upon Litvinov. Whether he
recognised Litvinov, or whether he felt ashamed
before a stranger, anyway he turned abruptly on
his heels like a bear, and gnawing his beard,
went into the station hut; his brother held
his tongue at once, and he too, turning like a
bear, followed him in. The great Gubaryov,
evidently, had not lost his influence even in
his own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">-308-</a></span></p>

<p>Bambaev was slowly moving after the
brothers.... Litvinov called him by his name.
He looked round, lifted up his head, and recognising
Litvinov, positively flew at him with
outstretched arms; but when he had run up to
the carriage, he clutched at the carriage door,
leaned over it, and began sobbing violently.</p>

<p>‘There, there, Bambaev,’ protested Litvinov,
bending over him and patting him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>But he went on sobbing. ‘You see ... you
see ... to what....’ he muttered brokenly.</p>

<p>‘Bambaev!’ thundered the brothers from the
hut.</p>

<p>Bambaev raised his head and hurriedly wiped
his tears.</p>

<p>‘Welcome, dear heart,’ he whispered, ‘welcome
and farewell!... You hear, they are
calling me.’</p>

<p>‘But what chance brought you here?’ inquired
Litvinov, ‘and what does it all mean? I
thought they were calling a Frenchman....’</p>

<p>‘I am their ... house-steward, butler,’ answered
Bambaev, and he pointed in the direction
of the hut. ‘And I’m turned Frenchman
for a joke. What could I do, brother? You
see, I’d nothing to eat, I’d lost my last
farthing, and so one’s forced to put one’s head
under the yoke. One can’t afford to be proud.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">-309-</a></span></p>

<p>‘But has he been long in Russia? and how
did he part from his comrades?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my boy, that’s all on the shelf now....
The wind’s changed, you see.... Madame
Suhantchikov, Matrona Semyonovna, he simply
kicked out. She went to Portugal in her grief.’</p>

<p>‘To Portugal? How absurd!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, brother, to Portugal, with two Matronovtsys.’</p>

<p>‘With whom?’</p>

<p>‘The Matronovtsys; that’s what the members
of her party are called.’</p>

<p>‘Matrona Semyonovna has a party of her
own? And is it a numerous one?’</p>

<p>‘Well, it consists of precisely those two. And
he will soon have been back here six months.
Others have got into difficulties, but he was
all right. He lives in the country with his
brother, and you should just hear him now....’</p>

<p>‘Bambaev!’</p>

<p>‘Coming, Stepan Nikolaitch, coming. And
you, dear old chap, are flourishing, enjoying
yourself! Well, thank God for that!
Where are you off to now?... There, I never
thought, I never guessed.... You remember
Baden? Ah, that was a place to live in! By
the way, you remember Bindasov too? Only
fancy, he’s dead. He turned exciseman, and
was in a row in a public-house; he got his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">-310-</a></span>
broken with a billiard-cue. Yes, yes, hard
times have come now! But still I say, Russia
... ah, our Russia! Only look at those two
geese; why, in the whole of Europe there’s
nothing like them! The genuine Arzamass
breed!’</p>

<p>And with this last tribute to his irrepressible
desire for enthusiasm, Bambaev ran off to the
station hut, where again, seasoned with opprobrious
epithets, his name was shouted.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the same day, Litvinov
was nearly reaching Tatyana’s village. The
little house where his former betrothed lived
stood on the slope of a hill, above a small river,
in the midst of a garden recently planted. The
house, too, was new, lately built, and could be
seen a long way off across the river and the
open country. Litvinov caught sight of it more
than a mile and a half off, with its sharp gable,
and its row of little windows, gleaming red in
the evening sun. At starting from the last
station he was conscious of a secret agitation;
now he was in a tremor simply&mdash;a happy
tremor, not unmixed with dread. ‘How will
they meet me?’ he thought, ‘how shall I present
myself?’... To turn off his thoughts with
something, he began talking with his driver, a
steady peasant with a grey beard, who charged
him, however, for twenty-five miles, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">-311-</a></span>
distance was not twenty. He asked him, did
he know the Shestov ladies?</p>

<p>‘The Shestov ladies? To be sure! Kind-hearted
ladies, and no doubt about it! They
doctor us too. It’s the truth I’m telling you.
Doctors they are! People go to them from all
about. Yes, indeed. They fairly crawl to them.
If any one, take an example, falls sick, or cuts
himself or anything, he goes straight to them
and they’ll give him a lotion directly, or
powders, or a plaster, and it’ll be all right, it’ll
do good. But one can’t show one’s gratitude,
we won’t consent to that, they say; it’s not for
money. They’ve set up a school too.... Not
but what that’s a foolish business!’</p>

<p>While the driver talked, Litvinov never took
his eyes off the house.... Out came a woman
in white on to the balcony, stood a little, stood
and then disappeared.... ‘Wasn’t it she?’
His heart was fairly bounding within him.
‘Quicker, quicker!’ he shouted to the driver;
the latter urged on the horses. A few instants
more ... and the carriage rolled in through
the opened gates.... And on the steps Kapitolina
Markovna was already standing, and
beside herself with joy, was clapping her hands
crying, ‘I heard him, I knew him first! It’s
he! it’s he!... I knew him!’</p>

<p>Litvinov jumped out of the carriage, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">-312-</a></span>
giving the page who ran up time to open
the door, and hurriedly embracing Kapitolina
Markovna, dashed into the house, through the
hall, into the dining-room.... Before him, all
shamefaced, stood Tatyana. She glanced at
him with her kind caressing eyes (she was a
little thinner, but it suited her), and gave him her
hand. But he did not take her hand, he fell on
his knees before her. She had not at all expected
this and did not know what to say, what
to do.... The tears started into her eyes.
She was frightened, but her whole face beamed
with delight.... ‘Grigory Mihalitch, what is
this, Grigory Mihalitch?’ she said ... while he
still kissed the hem of her dress ... and with
a thrill of tenderness he recalled that at Baden
he had been in the same way on his knees
before her.... But then&mdash;and now!</p>

<p>‘Tanya!’ he repeated, ‘Tanya! you have
forgiven me, Tanya!’</p>

<p>‘Aunt, aunt, what is this?’ cried Tatyana
turning to Kapitolina Markovna as she came in.</p>

<p>‘Don’t hinder him, Tanya,’ answered the kind
old lady. ‘You see the sinner has repented.’</p>



<p class="tb">But it is time to make an end; and indeed
there is nothing to add; the reader can guess
the rest by himself.... But what of Irina?</p>

<p>She is still as charming, in spite of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">-313-</a></span>
thirty years; young men out of number fall in
love with her, and would fall in love with her
even more, if ... if....</p>

<p>Reader, would you care to pass with us for a
few instants to Petersburg into one of the first
houses there? Look; before you is a spacious
apartment, we will not say richly&mdash;that is too
low an expression&mdash;but grandly, imposingly,
inspiringly decorated. Are you conscious of a
certain flutter of servility? Know that you have
entered a temple, a temple consecrated to the
highest propriety, to the loftiest philanthropy, in
a word, to things unearthly.... A kind of
mystic, truly mystic, hush enfolds you. The
velvet hangings on the doors, the velvet curtains
on the window, the bloated, spongy rug on the
floor, everything as it were destined and fitted
beforehand for subduing, for softening all coarse
sounds and violent sensations. The carefully
hung lamps inspire well-regulated emotions; a
discreet fragrance is diffused in the close air;
even the samovar on the table hisses in a restrained
and modest manner. The lady of the
house, an important personage in the Petersburg
world, speaks hardly audibly; she always speaks
as though there were some one dangerously ill,
almost dying in the room; the other ladies,
following her example, faintly whisper; while
her sister, pouring out tea, moves her lips so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">-314-</a></span>
absolutely without sound that a young man sitting
before her, who has been thrown by chance
into the temple of decorum, is positively at a
loss to know what she wants of him, while she
for the sixth time breathes to him, ‘<i>Voulez-vous
une tasse de thé?</i>’ In the corners are to be seen
young, good-looking men; their glances are
brightly, gently ingratiating; unruffled gentleness,
tinged with obsequiousness, is apparent in
their faces; a number of the stars and crosses
of distinction gleam softly on their breasts.
The conversation is always gentle; it turns on
religious and patriotic topics, the Mystic Drop,
F. N. Glinka, the missions in the East, the
monasteries and brotherhoods in White Russia.
At times, with muffled tread over the soft
carpets, move footmen in livery; their huge
calves, cased in tight silk stockings, shake
noiselessly at every step; the respectful motion
of the solid muscles only augments the general
impression of decorum, of solemnity, of sanctity.</p>

<p>It is a temple, a temple!</p>

<p>‘Have you seen Madame Ratmirov to-day?’
one great lady queries softly.</p>

<p>‘I met her to-day at Lise’s,’ the hostess answers
with her Æolian note. ‘I feel so sorry for her....
She has a satirical intellect ... <i>elle n’a
pas la foi</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ repeats the great lady ... ‘that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">-315-</a></span>
I remember, Piotr Ivanitch said about her,
and very true it is, <i>qu’elle a ... qu’elle a</i> an
ironical intellect.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Elle n’a pas la foi</i>,’ the hostess’s voice exhaled
like the smoke of incense,&mdash;‘<i>C’est une âme
égarée.</i> She has an ironical mind.’</p>



<p class="tb">And that is why the young men are not
all without exception in love with Irina....
They are afraid of her ... afraid of her
‘ironical intellect.’ That is the current phrase
about her; in it, as in every phrase, there is a
grain of truth. And not only the young men
are afraid of her; she is feared by grown men
too, and by men in high places, and even by
the grandest personages. No one can so truly
and artfully scent out the ridiculous or petty
side of a character, no one else has the gift of
stamping it mercilessly with the never-forgotten
word.... And the sting of that word is all the
sharper that it comes from lovely, sweetly fragrant
lips.... It’s hard to say what passes in
that soul; but in the crowd of her adorers
rumour does not recognise in any one the position
of a favoured suitor.</p>

<p>Irina’s husband is moving rapidly along the
path which among the French is called the
path of distinction. The stout general has shot
past him; the condescending one is left behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">-316-</a></span>
And in the same town in which Irina lives, lives
also our friend Sozont Potugin; he rarely sees
her, and she has no special necessity to keep up
any connection with him.... The little girl
who was committed to his care died not long
ago.</p>
